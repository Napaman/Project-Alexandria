<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John:</p>
<p class="verse">Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.</p>
<p class="verse">John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;</p>
<p class="verse">And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,</p>
<p class="verse">And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse">I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.</p>
<p class="verse">And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;</p>
<p class="verse">And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.</p>
<p class="verse">His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;</p>
<p class="verse">And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.</p>
<p class="verse">And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.</p>
<p class="verse">And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:</p>
<p class="verse">I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.</p>
<p class="verse">Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;</p>
<p class="verse">The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-revelation-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;</p>
<p class="verse">I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:</p>
<p class="verse">And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name’s sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.</p>
<p class="verse">Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.</p>
<p class="verse">But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.</p>
<p class="verse">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;</p>
<p class="verse">I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.</p>
<p class="verse">Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</p>
<p class="verse">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.</p>
<p class="verse">And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;</p>
<p class="verse">I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan’s seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</p>
<p class="verse">But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.</p>
<p class="verse">So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate.</p>
<p class="verse">Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.</p>
<p class="verse">And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;</p>
<p class="verse">I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.</p>
<p class="verse">Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.</p>
<p class="verse">And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.</p>
<p class="verse">But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.</p>
<p class="verse">But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.</p>
<p class="verse">And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will give him the morning star.</p>
<p class="verse">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-revelation-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.</p>
<p class="verse">Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.</p>
<p class="verse">Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.</p>
<p class="verse">He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.</p>
<p class="verse">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</p>
<p class="verse">And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;</p>
<p class="verse">I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.</p>
<p class="verse">Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name.</p>
<p class="verse">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</p>
<p class="verse">And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;</p>
<p class="verse">I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.</p>
<p class="verse">So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse">Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:</p>
<p class="verse">I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.</p>
<p class="verse">As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.</p>
<p class="verse">To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.</p>
<p class="verse">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-revelation-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.</p>
<p class="verse">And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.</p>
<p class="verse">And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.</p>
<p class="verse">And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.</p>
<p class="verse">And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.</p>
<p class="verse">And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle.</p>
<p class="verse">And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.</p>
<p class="verse">And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,</p>
<p class="verse">The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-revelation-5">
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.</p>
<p class="verse">And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?</p>
<p class="verse">And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.</p>
<p class="verse">And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.</p>
<p class="verse">And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.</p>
<p class="verse">And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;</p>
<p class="verse">And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;</p>
<p class="verse">Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.</p>
<p class="verse">And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</p>
<p class="verse">And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-revelation-6">
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse">And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.</p>
<p class="verse">And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see.</p>
<p class="verse">And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.</p>
<p class="verse">And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:</p>
<p class="verse">And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?</p>
<p class="verse">And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="verse">And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;</p>
<p class="verse">And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.</p>
<p class="verse">And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.</p>
<p class="verse">And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;</p>
<p class="verse">And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:</p>
<p class="verse">For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-revelation-7">
<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="verse">And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.</p>
<p class="verse">And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.</p>
<p class="verse">And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Nephthalim were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelve thousand.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.</p>
<p class="verse">After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;</p>
<p class="verse">And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?</p>
<p class="verse">And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.</p>
<p class="verse">They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.</p>
<p class="verse">For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="verse">And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.</p>
<p class="verse">And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.</p>
<p class="verse">And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.</p>
<p class="verse">And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel’s hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.</p>
<p class="verse">And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</p>
<p class="verse">The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.</p>
<p class="verse">And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;</p>
<p class="verse">And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse">And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;</p>
<p class="verse">And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.</p>
<p class="verse">And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.</p>
<p class="verse">And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-revelation-9">
<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
<p class="verse">And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.</p>
<p class="verse">And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.</p>
<p class="verse">And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.</p>
<p class="verse">And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.</p>
<p class="verse">And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.</p>
<p class="verse">And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.</p>
<p class="verse">And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.</p>
<p class="verse">And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.</p>
<p class="verse">And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.</p>
<p class="verse">And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.</p>
<p class="verse">One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter.</p>
<p class="verse">And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.</p>
<p class="verse">And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.</p>
<p class="verse">And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.</p>
<p class="verse">And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.</p>
<p class="verse">By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.</p>
<p class="verse">For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt.</p>
<p class="verse">And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:</p>
<p class="verse">Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.</p>

<h3>Chapter 10</h3>
<p class="verse">And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:</p>
<p class="verse">And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth,</p>
<p class="verse">And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.</p>
<p class="verse">And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,</p>
<p class="verse">And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer:</p>
<p class="verse">But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse">And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.</p>
<p class="verse">And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.</p>

<h3>Chapter 11</h3>
<p class="verse">And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.</p>
<p class="verse">But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.</p>
<p class="verse">These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.</p>
<p class="verse">These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.</p>
<p class="verse">And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.</p>
<p class="verse">And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.</p>
<p class="verse">And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them.</p>
<p class="verse">And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.</p>
<p class="verse">And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly.</p>
<p class="verse">And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.</p>
<p class="verse">And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, We give thee thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned.</p>
<p class="verse">And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.</p>

<h3>Chapter 12</h3>
<p class="verse">And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:</p>
<p class="verse">And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.</p>
<p class="verse">And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.</p>
<p class="verse">And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.</p>
<p class="verse">And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.</p>
<p class="verse">And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.</p>
<p class="verse">And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,</p>
<p class="verse">And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</p>
<p class="verse">And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.</p>
<p class="verse">And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.</p>
<p class="verse">And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.</p>
<p class="verse">And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.</p>
<p class="verse">And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse">And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.</p>

<h3>Chapter 13</h3>
<p class="verse">And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.</p>
<p class="verse">And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.</p>
<p class="verse">And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.</p>
<p class="verse">And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?</p>
<p class="verse">And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.</p>
<p class="verse">And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.</p>
<p class="verse">And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.</p>
<p class="verse">If any man have an ear, let him hear.</p>
<p class="verse">He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.</p>
<p class="verse">And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.</p>
<p class="verse">And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.</p>
<p class="verse">And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,</p>
<p class="verse">And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.</p>
<p class="verse">And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.</p>
<p class="verse">And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:</p>
<p class="verse">And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</p>
<p class="verse">Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.</p>

<h3>Chapter 14</h3>
<p class="verse">And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father’s name written in their foreheads.</p>
<p class="verse">And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:</p>
<p class="verse">And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.</p>
<p class="verse">And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</p>
<p class="verse">And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</p>
<p class="verse">And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,</p>
<p class="verse">The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:</p>
<p class="verse">And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.</p>
<p class="verse">Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.</p>
<p class="verse">And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.</p>
<p class="verse">And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.</p>
<p class="verse">And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.</p>
<p class="verse">And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.</p>
<p class="verse">And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.</p>
<p class="verse">And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.</p>

<p class="verse">And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.</p>
<p class="verse">Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.</p>

<p class="verse">And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles.</p>
<p class="verse">And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.</p>

<p class="verse">And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image.</p>
<p class="verse">And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.</p>
<p class="verse">And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.</p>
<p class="verse">And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.</p>
<p class="verse">For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.</p>
<p class="verse">And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.</p>
<p class="verse">And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.</p>
<p class="verse">And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.</p>
<p class="verse">And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,</p>
<p class="verse">And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.</p>
<p class="verse">And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.</p>
<p class="verse">And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.</p>

<p class="verse">And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.</p>
<p class="verse">And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.</p>
<p class="verse">And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.</p>

<h3>Chapter 17</h3>
<p class="verse">And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:</p>
<p class="verse">With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.</p>
<p class="verse">So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.</p>
<p class="verse">And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:</p>
<p class="verse">And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</p>
<p class="verse">And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.</p>
<p class="verse">And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.</p>
<p class="verse">The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.</p>
<p class="verse">And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.</p>
<p class="verse">And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.</p>
<p class="verse">And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.</p>
<p class="verse">And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.</p>
<p class="verse">These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.</p>
<p class="verse">These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.</p>
<p class="verse">And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.</p>
<p class="verse">And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.</p>
<p class="verse">For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="verse">And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.</p>

<p class="verse">And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.</p>
<p class="verse">And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.</p>
<p class="verse">For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.</p>
<p class="verse">And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</p>
<p class="verse">For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.</p>
<p class="verse">Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.</p>
<p class="verse">How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.</p>
<p class="verse">And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,</p>
<p class="verse">Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.</p>
<p class="verse">And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:</p>
<p class="verse">The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,</p>
<p class="verse">And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.</p>
<p class="verse">And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.</p>
<p class="verse">The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,</p>
<p class="verse">And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!</p>
<p class="verse">For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,</p>
<p class="verse">And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city!</p>
<p class="verse">And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.</p>
<p class="verse">Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.</p>
<p class="verse">And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.</p>
<p class="verse">And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;</p>
<p class="verse">And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.</p>
<p class="verse">And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.</p>

<p class="verse">And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:</p>
<p class="verse">For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And again they said, Alleluia.  And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.</p>
<p class="verse">And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.</p>
<p class="verse">And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.</p>
<p class="verse">And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.</p>
<p class="verse">Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.</p>
<p class="verse">And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.</p>
<p class="verse">And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</p>
<p class="verse">And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.</p>
<p class="verse">His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.</p>
<p class="verse">And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.</p>
<p class="verse">And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.</p>
<p class="verse">And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.</p>
<p class="verse">And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;</p>
<p class="verse">That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.</p>
<p class="verse">And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.</p>
<p class="verse">And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.</p>
<p class="verse">And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.</p>

<h3>Chapter 20</h3>
<p class="verse">And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,</p>
<p class="verse">And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.</p>
<p class="verse">And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.</p>
<p class="verse">But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,</p>
<p class="verse">And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.</p>
<p class="verse">And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.</p>
<p class="verse">And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</p>
<p class="verse">And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.</p>
<p class="verse">And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.</p>
<p class="verse">And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.</p>
<p class="verse">And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.</p>
<p class="verse">And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.</p>

<h3>Chapter 21</h3>
<p class="verse">And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.</p>
<p class="verse">And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</p>
<p class="verse">And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.</p>
<p class="verse">And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.</p>
<p class="verse">And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.</p>
<p class="verse">He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.</p>
<p class="verse">But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.</p>
<p class="verse">And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb’s wife.</p>
<p class="verse">And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,</p>
<p class="verse">Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;</p>
<p class="verse">And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:</p>
<p class="verse">On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.</p>
<p class="verse">And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</p>
<p class="verse">And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.</p>
<p class="verse">And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.</p>
<p class="verse">And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass.</p>
<p class="verse">And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;</p>
<p class="verse">The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.</p>
<p class="verse">And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.</p>
<p class="verse">And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.</p>
<p class="verse">And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.</p>
<p class="verse">And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.</p>
<p class="verse">And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb’s book of life.</p>

<p class="verse">And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</p>
<p class="verse">In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.</p>
<p class="verse">And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.</p>
<p class="verse">And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.</p>
<p class="verse">And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things.</p>
<p class="verse">Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.</p>
<p class="verse">And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.</p>
<p class="verse">He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.</p>
<p class="verse">I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.</p>
<p class="verse">For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.</p>
<p class="verse">I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.</p>
<p class="verse">For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:</p>
<p class="verse">And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.</p>
<p class="verse">He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,</p>
<p class="verse">To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,</p>
<p class="verse">Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints,</p>
<p class="verse">For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;</p>
<p class="verse">Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:</p>
<p class="verse">As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;</p>
<p class="verse">Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse">For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;</p>
<p class="verse">That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;</p>
<p class="verse">Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;</p>
<p class="verse">Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:</p>
<p class="verse">Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:</p>
<p class="verse">In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:</p>
<p class="verse">Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:</p>
<p class="verse">For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:</p>
<p class="verse">And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.</p>
<p class="verse">And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.</p>
<p class="verse">For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;</p>
<p class="verse">And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled</p>
<p class="verse">In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:</p>
<p class="verse">If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;</p>
<p class="verse">Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the church:</p>
<p class="verse">Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;</p>
<p class="verse">Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:</p>
<p class="verse">To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:</p>
<p class="verse">Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:</p>
<p class="verse">Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-colossians-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;</p>
<p class="verse">That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;</p>
<p class="verse">In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse">And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.</p>
<p class="verse">For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him:</p>
<p class="verse">Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="verse">Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:</p>
<p class="verse">In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:</p>
<p class="verse">Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.</p>
<p class="verse">And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;</p>
<p class="verse">Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;</p>
<p class="verse">And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</p>
<p class="verse">Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:</p>
<p class="verse">Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,</p>
<p class="verse">And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,</p>
<p class="verse">(Touch not; taste not; handle not;</p>
<p class="verse">Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?</p>
<p class="verse">Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-colossians-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.</p>
<p class="verse">When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.</p>
<p class="verse">Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:</p>
<p class="verse">For which things’ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:</p>
<p class="verse">In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.</p>
<p class="verse">But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.</p>
<p class="verse">Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;</p>
<p class="verse">And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:</p>
<p class="verse">Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.</p>
<p class="verse">Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;</p>
<p class="verse">Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.</p>
<p class="verse">And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.</p>
<p class="verse">And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.</p>
<p class="verse">Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</p>
<p class="verse">Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.</p>
<p class="verse">Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.</p>
<p class="verse">Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:</p>
<p class="verse">And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;</p>
<p class="verse">Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-colossians-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;</p>
<p class="verse">Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:</p>
<p class="verse">That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.</p>
<p class="verse">Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.</p>
<p class="verse">Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.</p>
<p class="verse">All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord:</p>
<p class="verse">Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;</p>
<p class="verse">With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you all things which are done here.</p>
<p class="verse">Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister’s son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me.</p>
<p class="verse">Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.</p>
<p class="verse">For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.</p>
<p class="verse">Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.</p>
<p class="verse">Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.</p>
<p class="verse">And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea.</p>
<p class="verse">And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.</p>
<p class="verse">The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.</p>

<p class="verse">So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.</p>
<p class="verse">For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.</p>
<p class="verse">For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;</p>
<p class="verse">And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 thessalonians-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:</p>
<p class="verse">But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.</p>
<p class="verse">For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:</p>
<p class="verse">But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.</p>
<p class="verse">For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness:</p>
<p class="verse">Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:</p>
<p class="verse">So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.</p>
<p class="verse">For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:</p>
<p class="verse">As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children,</p>
<p class="verse">That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.</p>
<p class="verse">For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.</p>
<p class="verse">For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:</p>
<p class="verse">Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:</p>
<p class="verse">Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.</p>
<p class="verse">But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.</p>
<p class="verse">For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?</p>
<p class="verse">For ye are our glory and joy.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 thessalonians-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;</p>
<p class="verse">And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:</p>
<p class="verse">That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.</p>
<p class="verse">For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.</p>
<p class="verse">For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.</p>
<p class="verse">But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:</p>
<p class="verse">For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;</p>
<p class="verse">Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?</p>
<p class="verse">Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:</p>
<p class="verse">To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 thessalonians-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.</p>
<p class="verse">For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:</p>
<p class="verse">That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;</p>
<p class="verse">Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:</p>
<p class="verse">That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.</p>
<p class="verse">For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.</p>
<p class="verse">He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse">But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.</p>
<p class="verse">And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;</p>
<p class="verse">And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;</p>
<p class="verse">That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing.</p>
<p class="verse">But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.</p>
<p class="verse">For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.</p>
<p class="verse">For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.</p>
<p class="verse">For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:</p>
<p class="verse">Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore comfort one another with these words.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 thessalonians-5">
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.</p>
<p class="verse">For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.</p>
<p class="verse">But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.</p>
<p class="verse">For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.</p>
<p class="verse">But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.</p>
<p class="verse">For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="verse">Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.</p>
<p class="verse">And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;</p>
<p class="verse">And to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. And be at peace among yourselves.</p>
<p class="verse">Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.</p>
<p class="verse">See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.</p>
<p class="verse">Rejoice evermore.</p>
<p class="verse">Pray without ceasing.</p>
<p class="verse">In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.</p>
<p class="verse">Quench not the Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse">Despise not prophesyings.</p>
<p class="verse">Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.</p>
<p class="verse">Abstain from all appearance of evil.</p>
<p class="verse">And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.</p>
<p class="verse">Brethren, pray for us.</p>
<p class="verse">Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.</p>
<p class="verse">I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.</p>
<p class="verse">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse">Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;</p>
<p class="verse">So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:</p>
<p class="verse">Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:</p>
<p class="verse">Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;</p>
<p class="verse">And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,</p>
<p class="verse">In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse">Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;</p>
<p class="verse">When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:</p>
<p class="verse">That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 thessalonians-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,</p>
<p class="verse">That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.</p>
<p class="verse">Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;</p>
<p class="verse">Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.</p>
<p class="verse">Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?</p>
<p class="verse">And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.</p>
<p class="verse">For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.</p>
<p class="verse">And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:</p>
<p class="verse">Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,</p>
<p class="verse">And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.</p>
<p class="verse">And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:</p>
<p class="verse">That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</p>
<p class="verse">But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:</p>
<p class="verse">Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.</p>
<p class="verse">Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,</p>
<p class="verse">Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 thessalonians-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:</p>
<p class="verse">And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith.</p>
<p class="verse">But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil.</p>
<p class="verse">And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.</p>
<p class="verse">For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;</p>
<p class="verse">Neither did we eat any man’s bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:</p>
<p class="verse">Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us.</p>
<p class="verse">For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.</p>
<p class="verse">For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.</p>
<p class="verse">Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.</p>
<p class="verse">But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.</p>
<p class="verse">And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all.</p>
<p class="verse">The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.</p>
<p class="verse">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;</p>
<p class="verse">Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,</p>
<p class="verse">Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:</p>
<p class="verse">From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;</p>
<p class="verse">Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</p>
<p class="verse">But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;</p>
<p class="verse">Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</p>
<p class="verse">For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;</p>
<p class="verse">According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</p>
<p class="verse">And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;</p>
<p class="verse">Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</p>
<p class="verse">And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.</p>
<p class="verse">Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;</p>
<p class="verse">Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:</p>
<p class="verse">Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 timothy-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;</p>
<p class="verse">For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.</p>
<p class="verse">For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;</p>
<p class="verse">Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;</p>
<p class="verse">Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.</p>
<p class="verse">Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.</p>
<p class="verse">I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.</p>
<p class="verse">In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;</p>
<p class="verse">But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.</p>
<p class="verse">Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.</p>
<p class="verse">But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.</p>
<p class="verse">For Adam was first formed, then Eve.</p>
<p class="verse">And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.</p>
<p class="verse">Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 timothy-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.</p>
<p class="verse">A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;</p>
<p class="verse">Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;</p>
<p class="verse">One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;</p>
<p class="verse">(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)</p>
<p class="verse">Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;</p>
<p class="verse">Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</p>
<p class="verse">And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless.</p>
<p class="verse">Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.</p>
<p class="verse">Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.</p>
<p class="verse">For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:</p>
<p class="verse">But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 timothy-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;</p>
<p class="verse">Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;</p>
<p class="verse">Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:</p>
<p class="verse">For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</p>
<p class="verse">If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.</p>
<p class="verse">But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness.</p>
<p class="verse">For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</p>
<p class="verse">This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.</p>
<p class="verse">For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.</p>
<p class="verse">These things command and teach.</p>
<p class="verse">Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</p>
<p class="verse">Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse">Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.</p>
<p class="verse">Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.</p>
<p class="verse">Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 timothy-5">
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;</p>
<p class="verse">The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.</p>
<p class="verse">Honour widows that are widows indeed.</p>
<p class="verse">But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.</p>
<p class="verse">Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.</p>
<p class="verse">But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.</p>
<p class="verse">And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.</p>
<p class="verse">But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.</p>
<p class="verse">Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man,</p>
<p class="verse">Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints’ feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.</p>
<p class="verse">But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;</p>
<p class="verse">Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.</p>
<p class="verse">And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.</p>
<p class="verse">I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.</p>
<p class="verse">For some are already turned aside after Satan.</p>
<p class="verse">If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.</p>
<p class="verse">Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse">For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.</p>
<p class="verse">Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.</p>
<p class="verse">Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.</p>
<p class="verse">I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.</p>
<p class="verse">Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep thyself pure.</p>
<p class="verse">Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thine often infirmities.</p>
<p class="verse">Some men’s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 timothy-6">
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse">Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.</p>
<p class="verse">And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.</p>
<p class="verse">If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;</p>
<p class="verse">He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,</p>
<p class="verse">Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.</p>
<p class="verse">But godliness with contentment is great gain.</p>
<p class="verse">For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.</p>
<p class="verse">And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.</p>
<p class="verse">But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.</p>
<p class="verse">For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</p>
<p class="verse">But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.</p>
<p class="verse">Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.</p>
<p class="verse">I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;</p>
<p class="verse">That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse">Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;</p>
<p class="verse">Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;</p>
<p class="verse">That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;</p>
<p class="verse">Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse">O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:</p>
<p class="verse">Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,</p>
<p class="verse">To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;</p>
<p class="verse">Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</p>
<p class="verse">When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</p>
<p class="verse">For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</p>
<p class="verse">Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;</p>
<p class="verse">Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,</p>
<p class="verse">But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:</p>
<p class="verse">Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="verse">For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.</p>
<p class="verse">Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.</p>
<p class="verse">This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</p>
<p class="verse">The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:</p>
<p class="verse">But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me.</p>
<p class="verse">The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 timothy-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.</p>
<p class="verse">And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</p>
<p class="verse">The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.</p>
<p class="verse">Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</p>
<p class="verse">Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:</p>
<p class="verse">Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</p>
<p class="verse">It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:</p>
<p class="verse">If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:</p>
<p class="verse">If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.</p>
<p class="verse">Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.</p>
<p class="verse">Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</p>
<p class="verse">But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.</p>
<p class="verse">And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</p>
<p class="verse">Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse">But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.</p>
<p class="verse">If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, and prepared unto every good work.</p>
<p class="verse">Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p>
<p class="verse">But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.</p>
<p class="verse">And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,</p>
<p class="verse">In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;</p>
<p class="verse">And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 timothy-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</p>
<p class="verse">For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</p>
<p class="verse">Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</p>
<p class="verse">Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</p>
<p class="verse">Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</p>
<p class="verse">For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,</p>
<p class="verse">Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.</p>
<p class="verse">But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.</p>
<p class="verse">But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,</p>
<p class="verse">Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</p>
<p class="verse">But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</p>
<p class="verse">But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;</p>
<p class="verse">And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</p>
<p class="verse">That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 timothy-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;</p>
<p class="verse">Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse">For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.</p>
<p class="verse">But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.</p>
<p class="verse">For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</p>
<p class="verse">I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:</p>
<p class="verse">Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.</p>
<p class="verse">Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:</p>
<p class="verse">For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.</p>
<p class="verse">Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</p>
<p class="verse">And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.</p>
<p class="verse">The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.</p>
<p class="verse">Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:</p>
<p class="verse">Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.</p>
<p class="verse">At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.</p>
<p class="verse">Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.</p>
<p class="verse">Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.</p>
<p class="verse">Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</p>
<p class="verse">The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</p>
<p class="verse">In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;</p>
<p class="verse">But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</p>
<p class="verse">To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</p>
<p class="verse">For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</p>
<p class="verse">If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.</p>
<p class="verse">For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;</p>
<p class="verse">But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;</p>
<p class="verse">Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</p>
<p class="verse">For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:</p>
<p class="verse">Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.</p>
<p class="verse">One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.</p>
<p class="verse">This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</p>
<p class="verse">Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.</p>
<p class="verse">They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-titus-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:</p>
<p class="verse">That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.</p>
<p class="verse">The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;</p>
<p class="verse">That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,</p>
<p class="verse">To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</p>
<p class="verse">Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.</p>
<p class="verse">In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,</p>
<p class="verse">Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.</p>
<p class="verse">Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;</p>
<p class="verse">Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</p>
<p class="verse">For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,</p>
<p class="verse">Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;</p>
<p class="verse">Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</p>
<p class="verse">Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</p>
<p class="verse">These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-titus-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,</p>
<p class="verse">To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.</p>
<p class="verse">For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</p>
<p class="verse">But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,</p>
<p class="verse">Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</p>
<p class="verse">Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</p>
<p class="verse">That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse">This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</p>
<p class="verse">But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</p>
<p class="verse">A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;</p>
<p class="verse">Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.</p>
<p class="verse">When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.</p>
<p class="verse">Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</p>
<p class="verse">All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,</p>
<p class="verse">And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</p>
<p class="verse">Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</p>
<p class="verse">Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</p>
<p class="verse">That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</p>
<p class="verse">Yet for love’s sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</p>
<p class="verse">Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</p>
<p class="verse">Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</p>
<p class="verse">Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</p>
<p class="verse">But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</p>
<p class="verse">For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</p>
<p class="verse">Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</p>
<p class="verse">If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</p>
<p class="verse">If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;</p>
<p class="verse">I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</p>
<p class="verse">But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</p>
<p class="verse">Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</p>
<p class="verse">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>
