<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.</p>
<p class="verse">And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.</p>
<p class="verse">But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back?</p>
<p class="verse">And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to meet you, and told you these words?</p>
<p class="verse">And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</p>
<p class="verse">Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</p>
<p class="verse">And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.</p>
<p class="verse">And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.</p>
<p class="verse">So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 kings-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said unto him, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel.</p>
<p class="verse">And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.</p>
<p class="verse">And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.</p>
<p class="verse">And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.</p>
<p class="verse">He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;</p>
<p class="verse">And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.</p>
<p class="verse">And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?</p>
<p class="verse">And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, and the ground barren.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land.</p>
<p class="verse">So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake.</p>
<p class="verse">And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.</p>
<p class="verse">And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.</p>
<p class="verse">And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 kings-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.</p>
<p class="verse">And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.</p>
<p class="verse">And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.</p>
<p class="verse">But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy horses.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.</p>
<p class="verse">So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days’ journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!</p>
<p class="verse">But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel’s servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.</p>
<p class="verse">But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches.</p>
<p class="verse">For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.</p>
<p class="verse">And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.</p>
<p class="verse">And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border.</p>
<p class="verse">And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood:</p>
<p class="verse">And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.</p>
<p class="verse">And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not.</p>
<p class="verse">Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 kings-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.</p>
<p class="verse">Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.</p>
<p class="verse">And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full.</p>
<p class="verse">So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.</p>
<p class="verse">Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.</p>
<p class="verse">And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.</p>
<p class="verse">And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.</p>
<p class="verse">Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.</p>
<p class="verse">And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid.</p>
<p class="verse">And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.</p>
<p class="verse">And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out.</p>
<p class="verse">And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.</p>
<p class="verse">Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.</p>
<p class="verse">So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:</p>
<p class="verse">Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well.</p>
<p class="verse">And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her: and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.</p>
<p class="verse">Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?</p>
<p class="verse">Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.</p>
<p class="verse">And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.</p>
<p class="verse">And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed.</p>
<p class="verse">He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.</p>
<p class="verse">Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.</p>
<p class="verse">And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son.</p>
<p class="verse">Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse">And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not.</p>
<p class="verse">So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O thou man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.</p>
<p class="verse">And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat.</p>
<p class="verse">And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the LORD.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 kings-5">
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was a leper.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman’s wife.</p>
<p class="verse">And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.</p>
<p class="verse">And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.</p>
<p class="verse">And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.</p>
<p class="verse">But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.</p>
<p class="verse">Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.</p>
<p class="verse">And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?</p>
<p class="verse">Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</p>
<p class="verse">And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant.</p>
<p class="verse">But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.</p>
<p class="verse">And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules’ burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.</p>
<p class="verse">But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.</p>
<p class="verse">So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.</p>
<p class="verse">And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.</p>
<p class="verse">But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?</p>
<p class="verse">The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.</p>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse">And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.</p>
<p class="verse">Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye.</p>
<p class="verse">And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.</p>
<p class="verse">So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood.</p>
<p class="verse">But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.</p>
<p class="verse">And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his hand, and took it.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.</p>
<p class="verse">And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel?</p>
<p class="verse">And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?</p>
<p class="verse">And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he led them to Samaria.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?</p>
<p class="verse">And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.</p>
<p class="verse">And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.</p>
<p class="verse">And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass’s head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove’s dung for five pieces of silver.</p>
<p class="verse">And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow.</p>
<p class="verse">So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.</p>
<p class="verse">Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.</p>
<p class="verse">But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master’s feet behind him?</p>
<p class="verse">And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer?</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="verse">Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.</p>
<p class="verse">Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?</p>
<p class="verse">If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.</p>
<p class="verse">And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.</p>
<p class="verse">For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.</p>
<p class="verse">And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it.</p>
<p class="verse">Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king’s household.</p>
<p class="verse">So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were.</p>
<p class="verse">And he called the porters; and they told it to the king’s house within.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we be hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.</p>
<p class="verse">And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see.</p>
<p class="verse">They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.</p>
<p class="verse">And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.</p>
<p class="verse">And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:</p>
<p class="verse">And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="verse">Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years.</p>
<p class="verse">And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass at the seven years’ end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?</p>
<p class="verse">So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?</p>
<p class="verse">And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall surely die.</p>
<p class="verse">And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.</p>
<p class="verse">And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child.</p>
<p class="verse">And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath shewed me that thou shalt be king over Syria.</p>
<p class="verse">So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou shouldest surely recover.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse">And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Je hoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.</p>
<p class="verse">Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant’s sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his children.</p>
<p class="verse">In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.</p>
<p class="verse">So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.</p>
<p class="verse">And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>
<p class="verse">And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse">In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.</p>
<p class="verse">Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab: for he was the son in law of the house of Ahab.</p>
<p class="verse">And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.</p>
<p class="verse">And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
<p class="verse">And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in thine hand, and go to Ramothgilead:</p>
<p class="verse">And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber;</p>
<p class="verse">Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.</p>
<p class="verse">So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramothgilead.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain.</p>
<p class="verse">And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.</p>
<p class="verse">For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel:</p>
<p class="verse">And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:</p>
<p class="verse">And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.</p>
<p class="verse">And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.</p>
<p class="verse">So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.</p>
<p class="verse">But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.</p>
<p class="verse">So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.</p>
<p class="verse">And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?</p>
<p class="verse">So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again.</p>
<p class="verse">Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.</p>
<p class="verse">And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.</p>
<p class="verse">And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?</p>
<p class="verse">And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden upon him;</p>
<p class="verse">Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.</p>
<p class="verse">And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.</p>
<p class="verse">And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.</p>
<p class="verse">And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?</p>
<p class="verse">And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under foot.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king’s daughter.</p>
<p class="verse">And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel:</p>
<p class="verse">And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.</p>

<h3>Chapter 10</h3>
<p class="verse">And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab’s children, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master’s sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armour;</p>
<p class="verse">Look even out the best and meetest of your master’s sons, and set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.</p>
<p class="verse">But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?</p>
<p class="verse">And he that was over the house, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and the bringers up of the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou that which is good in thine eyes.</p>
<p class="verse">Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be mine, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master’s sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time. Now the king’s sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought them up.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king’s sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel.</p>
<p class="verse">And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king’s sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?</p>
<p class="verse">Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab: for the LORD hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah.</p>
<p class="verse">So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.</p>
<p class="verse">And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing house in the way,</p>
<p class="verse">Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they made him ride in his chariot.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spake to Elijah.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of him.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.</p>
<p class="verse">And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them.</p>
<p class="verse">And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin.</p>
<p class="verse">In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel;</p>
<p class="verse">From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse">And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years.</p>

<h3>Chapter 11</h3>
<p class="verse">And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king’s sons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.</p>
<p class="verse">And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And Athaliah did reign over the land.</p>
<p class="verse">And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and shewed them the king’s son.</p>
<p class="verse">And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king’s house;</p>
<p class="verse">And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down.</p>
<p class="verse">And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in.</p>
<p class="verse">And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.</p>
<p class="verse">And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David’s spears and shields, that were in the temple of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple, along by the altar and the temple.</p>
<p class="verse">And he brought forth the king’s son, and put the crown upon him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her forth without the ranges: and him that followeth her kill with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king’s house: and there was she slain.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people, that they should be the LORD’s people; between the king also and the people.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king’s house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king’s house.</p>
<p class="verse">Seven years old was Jehoash when he began to reign.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 kings-12">
<h3>Chapter 12</h3>
<p class="verse">In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Zibiah of Beersheba.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.</p>
<p class="verse">But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD, even the money of every one that passeth the account, the money that every man is set at, and all the money that cometh into any man’s heart to bring into the house of the LORD,</p>
<p class="verse">Let the priests take it to them, every man of his acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall be found.</p>
<p class="verse">But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.</p>
<p class="verse">Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the other priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house? now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people, neither to repair the breaches of the house.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king’s scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the LORD: and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought upon the house of the LORD,</p>
<p class="verse">And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD:</p>
<p class="verse">But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt faithfully.</p>
<p class="verse">The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the LORD: it was the priests’.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king’s house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.</p>

<h3>Chapter 13</h3>
<p class="verse">In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned seventeen years.</p>
<p class="verse">And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.</p>
<p class="verse">And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all their days.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them.</p>
<p class="verse">(And the LORD gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents, as beforetime.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein: and there remained the grove also in Samaria.)</p>
<p class="verse">Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse">In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned sixteen years.</p>
<p class="verse">And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin: but he walked therein.</p>
<p class="verse">And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>
<p class="verse">And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto him bow and arrows.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the bow. And he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his hands upon the king’s hands.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORD’s deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote thrice, and stayed.</p>
<p class="verse">And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.</p>
<p class="verse">But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet.</p>
<p class="verse">So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of Israel.</p>

<h3>Chapter 14</h3>
<p class="verse">In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not like David his father: he did according to all things as Joash his father did.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yet the people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father.</p>
<p class="verse">But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.</p>
<p class="verse">He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee up: glory of this, and tarry at home: for why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?</p>
<p class="verse">But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to their tents.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king’s house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse">And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.</p>
<p class="verse">And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>
<p class="verse">Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.</p>
<p class="verse">And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.</p>
<p class="verse">He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, and reigned forty and one years.</p>
<p class="verse">And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.</p>
<p class="verse">He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which was of Gathhepher.</p>
<p class="verse">For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter: for there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.</p>

<p class="verse">And he brought also the brasen altar, which was before the LORD, from the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the altar.</p>
<p class="verse">And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat offering, and the king’s burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire by.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded.</p>
<p class="verse">And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it, and put it upon a pavement of stones.</p>
<p class="verse">And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king’s entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD for the king of Assyria.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>
<p class="verse">And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.</p>

<h3>Chapter 17</h3>
<p class="verse">In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.</p>
<p class="verse">And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as the kings of Israel that were before him.</p>
<p class="verse">Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.</p>
<p class="verse">In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.</p>
<p class="verse">For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,</p>
<p class="verse">And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made.</p>
<p class="verse">And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right against the LORD their God, and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.</p>
<p class="verse">And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree:</p>
<p class="verse">And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them; and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger:</p>
<p class="verse">For they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them, Ye shall not do this thing.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse">Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God.</p>
<p class="verse">And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that were round about them, concerning whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not do like them.</p>
<p class="verse">And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.</p>
<p class="verse">And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.</p>
<p class="verse">Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.</p>
<p class="verse">For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin.</p>
<p class="verse">For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;</p>
<p class="verse">Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which slew some of them.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.</p>
<p class="verse">Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.</p>
<p class="verse">And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,</p>
<p class="verse">And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.</p>
<p class="verse">So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.</p>
<p class="verse">They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.</p>
<p class="verse">Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;</p>
<p class="verse">With whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:</p>
<p class="verse">But the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.</p>
<p class="verse">And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.</p>
<p class="verse">And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods.</p>
<p class="verse">But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner.</p>
<p class="verse">So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children’s children: as did their fathers, so do they unto this day.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 kings-18">
<h3>Chapter 18</h3>
<p class="verse">Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.</p>
<p class="verse">Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.</p>
<p class="verse">And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father did.</p>
<p class="verse">He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.</p>
<p class="verse">He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.</p>
<p class="verse">For he clave to the LORD, and departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.</p>
<p class="verse">He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.</p>
<p class="verse">And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes:</p>
<p class="verse">Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them.</p>
<p class="verse">Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.</p>
<p class="verse">And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.</p>
<p class="verse">And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king’s house.</p>
<p class="verse">At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller’s field.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.</p>
<p class="verse">And Rabshakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?</p>
<p class="verse">Thou sayest, (but they are but vain words,) I have counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?</p>
<p class="verse">Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.</p>
<p class="verse">But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.</p>
<p class="verse">How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?</p>
<p class="verse">Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and talk not with us in the Jews’ language in the ears of the people that are on the wall.</p>
<p class="verse">But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?</p>
<p class="verse">Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria:</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand:</p>
<p class="verse">Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.</p>
<p class="verse">Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and then eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern:</p>
<p class="verse">Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.</p>
<p class="verse">Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</p>
<p class="verse">Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand?</p>
<p class="verse">Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?</p>
<p class="verse">But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king’s commandment was, saying, Answer him not.</p>
<p class="verse">Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 kings-19">
<h3>Chapter 19</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.</p>
<p class="verse">And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.</p>
<p class="verse">It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left.</p>
<p class="verse">So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</p>
<p class="verse">And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.</p>
<p class="verse">So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?</p>
<p class="verse">Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar?</p>
<p class="verse">Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?</p>
<p class="verse">And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.</p>
<p class="verse">LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the living God.</p>
<p class="verse">Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands,</p>
<p class="verse">And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD God, even thou only.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.</p>
<p class="verse">This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">By thy messengers thou hast reproached the LORD, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.</p>
<p class="verse">I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.</p>
<p class="verse">Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the house tops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.</p>
<p class="verse">But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.</p>
<p class="verse">Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.</p>
<p class="verse">And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.</p>
<p class="verse">For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.</p>
<p class="verse">By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.</p>
<p class="verse">So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 kings-20">
<h3>Chapter 20</h3>
<p class="verse">In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.</p>
<p class="verse">Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.</p>
<p class="verse">And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.</p>
<p class="verse">And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day?</p>
<p class="verse">And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?</p>
<p class="verse">And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.</p>
<p class="verse">And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.</p>
<p class="verse">At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.</p>
<p class="verse">And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.</p>
<p class="verse">Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All the things that are in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.</p>
<p class="verse">And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace and truth be in my days?</p>
<p class="verse">And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>
<p class="verse">And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 kings-21">
<h3>Chapter 21</h3>
<p class="verse">Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Hephzibah.</p>
<p class="verse">And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.</p>
<p class="verse">And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.</p>
<p class="verse">And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.</p>
<p class="verse">And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:</p>
<p class="verse">Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.</p>
<p class="verse">But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols:</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;</p>
<p class="verse">Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>
<p class="verse">And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse">Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.</p>
<p class="verse">And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh did.</p>
<p class="verse">And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:</p>
<p class="verse">And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house.</p>
<p class="verse">And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>
<p class="verse">And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.</p>

<h3>Chapter 22</h3>
<p class="verse">Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.</p>
<p class="verse">And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people:</p>
<p class="verse">And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house,</p>
<p class="verse">Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.</p>
<p class="verse">And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.</p>
<p class="verse">And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king’s, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Go ye, enquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us.</p>
<p class="verse">So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.</p>
<p class="verse">And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me,</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read:</p>
<p class="verse">Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched.</p>
<p class="verse">But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the LORD, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, As touching the words which thou hast heard;</p>
<p class="verse">Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 kings-23">
<h3>Chapter 23</h3>
<p class="verse">And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Bethel.</p>
<p class="verse">And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people.</p>
<p class="verse">And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove.</p>
<p class="verse">And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba, and brake down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man’s left hand at the gate of the city.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren.</p>
<p class="verse">And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.</p>
<p class="verse">And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and brake them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.</p>
<p class="verse">And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.</p>
<p class="verse">And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he brake down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.</p>
<p class="verse">And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.</p>
<p class="verse">Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God, which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Bethel.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.</p>
<p class="verse">And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars, and burned men’s bones upon them, and returned to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto the LORD your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant.</p>
<p class="verse">Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;</p>
<p class="verse">But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this passover was holden to the LORD in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him.</p>
<p class="verse">Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>
<p class="verse">In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.</p>
<p class="verse">And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father’s stead.</p>
<p class="verse">Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</p>
<p class="verse">And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.</p>
<p class="verse">And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.</p>
<p class="verse">And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaohnechoh.</p>
<p class="verse">Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.</p>
<p class="verse">And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 kings-24">
<h3>Chapter 24</h3>
<p class="verse">In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servants the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse">Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did;</p>
<p class="verse">And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not pardon.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>
<p class="verse">So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land: for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse">Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother’s name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done.</p>
<p class="verse">At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.</p>
<p class="verse">And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and his servants did besiege it.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.</p>
<p class="verse">And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said.</p>
<p class="verse">And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.</p>
<p class="verse">And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king’s mother, and the king’s wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father’s brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.</p>
<p class="verse">Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</p>
<p class="verse">And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.</p>
<p class="verse">For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 kings-25">
<h3>Chapter 25</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it; and they built forts against it round about.</p>
<p class="verse">And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.</p>
<p class="verse">And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.</p>
<p class="verse">And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king’s garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city round about:) and the king went the way toward the plain.</p>
<p class="verse">And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him.</p>
<p class="verse">So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.</p>
<p class="verse">And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse">And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem:</p>
<p class="verse">And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king’s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great man’s house burnt he with fire.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away.</p>
<p class="verse">But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.</p>
<p class="verse">And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse">And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.</p>
<p class="verse">And the firepans, and the bowls, and such things as were of gold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.</p>
<p class="verse">The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without weight.</p>
<p class="verse">The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the chapiter upon it was brass: and the height of the chapiter three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about, all of brass: and like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen work.</p>
<p class="verse">And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:</p>
<p class="verse">And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king’s presence, which were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, which mustered the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the city:</p>
<p class="verse">And Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land.</p>
<p class="verse">And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.</p>
<p class="verse">And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.</p>
<p class="verse">And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you.</p>
<p class="verse">But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldees.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;</p>
<p class="verse">And he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon;</p>
<p class="verse">And changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life.</p>
<p class="verse">And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,</p>
<p class="verse">(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)</p>
<p class="verse">Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;</p>
<p class="verse">And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:</p>
<p class="verse">By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:</p>
<p class="verse">Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse">To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</p>
<p class="verse">For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;</p>
<p class="verse">Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;</p>
<p class="verse">That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.</p>
<p class="verse">Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.</p>
<p class="verse">I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.</p>
<p class="verse">So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.</p>
<p class="verse">For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</p>
<p class="verse">For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</p>
<p class="verse">For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;</p>
<p class="verse">Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:</p>
<p class="verse">Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</p>
<p class="verse">Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</p>
<p class="verse">And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:</p>
<p class="verse">Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:</p>
<p class="verse">And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.</p>
<p class="verse">And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;</p>
<p class="verse">Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,</p>
<p class="verse">Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</p>
<p class="verse">Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:</p>
<p class="verse">Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-romans-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.</p>
<p class="verse">But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.</p>
<p class="verse">And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</p>
<p class="verse">Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?</p>
<p class="verse">But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;</p>
<p class="verse">Who will render to every man according to his deeds:</p>
<p class="verse">To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:</p>
<p class="verse">But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,</p>
<p class="verse">Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;</p>
<p class="verse">But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:</p>
<p class="verse">For there is no respect of persons with God.</p>
<p class="verse">For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;</p>
<p class="verse">(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</p>
<p class="verse">For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:</p>
<p class="verse">Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)</p>
<p class="verse">In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,</p>
<p class="verse">And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;</p>
<p class="verse">And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,</p>
<p class="verse">An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?</p>
<p class="verse">Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?</p>
<p class="verse">Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?</p>
<p class="verse">For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.</p>
<p class="verse">For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</p>
<p class="verse">And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?</p>
<p class="verse">For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:</p>
<p class="verse">But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-romans-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?</p>
<p class="verse">Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.</p>
<p class="verse">For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</p>
<p class="verse">God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.</p>
<p class="verse">But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)</p>
<p class="verse">God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?</p>
<p class="verse">For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</p>
<p class="verse">And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.</p>
<p class="verse">What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;</p>
<p class="verse">As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:</p>
<p class="verse">There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.</p>
<p class="verse">They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</p>
<p class="verse">Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:</p>
<p class="verse">Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</p>
<p class="verse">Their feet are swift to shed blood:</p>
<p class="verse">Destruction and misery are in their ways:</p>
<p class="verse">And the way of peace have they not known:</p>
<p class="verse">There is no fear of God before their eyes.</p>
<p class="verse">Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</p>
<p class="verse">But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;</p>
<p class="verse">Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:</p>
<p class="verse">For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</p>
<p class="verse">Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</p>
<p class="verse">Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;</p>
<p class="verse">To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.</p>
<p class="verse">Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:</p>
<p class="verse">Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</p>
<p class="verse">Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-romans-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?</p>
<p class="verse">For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God.</p>
<p class="verse">For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse">Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.</p>
<p class="verse">But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse">Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.</p>
<p class="verse">Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse">How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</p>
<p class="verse">And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:</p>
<p class="verse">And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.</p>
<p class="verse">For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.</p>
<p class="verse">For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:</p>
<p class="verse">Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,</p>
<p class="verse">(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.</p>
<p class="verse">Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.</p>
<p class="verse">And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah’s womb:</p>
<p class="verse">He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;</p>
<p class="verse">And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.</p>
<p class="verse">And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse">Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;</p>
<p class="verse">But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;</p>
<p class="verse">Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-romans-5">
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse">By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;</p>
<p class="verse">And patience, experience; and experience, hope:</p>
<p class="verse">And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.</p>
<p class="verse">For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.</p>
<p class="verse">For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.</p>
<p class="verse">But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</p>
<p class="verse">Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.</p>
<p class="verse">For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.</p>
<p class="verse">And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:</p>
<p class="verse">(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam’s transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.</p>
<p class="verse">But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.</p>
<p class="verse">And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification.</p>
<p class="verse">For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.</p>
<p class="verse">For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:</p>
<p class="verse">That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-romans-6">
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse">What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</p>
<p class="verse">God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?</p>
<p class="verse">Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</p>
<p class="verse">For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:</p>
<p class="verse">Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.</p>
<p class="verse">For he that is dead is freed from sin.</p>
<p class="verse">Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:</p>
<p class="verse">Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.</p>
<p class="verse">For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.</p>
<p class="verse">For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</p>
<p class="verse">What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.</p>
<p class="verse">Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</p>
<p class="verse">But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.</p>
<p class="verse">Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse">I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.</p>
<p class="verse">For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse">What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.</p>
<p class="verse">But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.</p>
<p class="verse">For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-romans-7">
<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="verse">Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?</p>
<p class="verse">For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.</p>
<p class="verse">So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.</p>
<p class="verse">For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</p>
<p class="verse">But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.</p>
<p class="verse">What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.</p>
<p class="verse">But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.</p>
<p class="verse">For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.</p>
<p class="verse">And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.</p>
<p class="verse">For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</p>
<p class="verse">Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.</p>
<p class="verse">For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.</p>
<p class="verse">For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.</p>
<p class="verse">If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.</p>
<p class="verse">Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</p>
<p class="verse">For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.</p>
<p class="verse">For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.</p>
<p class="verse">Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</p>
<p class="verse">I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.</p>
<p class="verse">For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:</p>
<p class="verse">But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.</p>
<p class="verse">O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</p>
<p class="verse">I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-romans-8">
<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="verse">There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse">For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.</p>
<p class="verse">For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:</p>
<p class="verse">That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse">For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse">For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.</p>
<p class="verse">Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</p>
<p class="verse">So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</p>
<p class="verse">But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</p>
<p class="verse">And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse">But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.</p>
<p class="verse">For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.</p>
<p class="verse">For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.</p>
<p class="verse">For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</p>
<p class="verse">The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:</p>
<p class="verse">And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.</p>
<p class="verse">For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.</p>
<p class="verse">For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.</p>
<p class="verse">For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,</p>
<p class="verse">Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</p>
<p class="verse">For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.</p>
<p class="verse">And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.</p>
<p class="verse">For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?</p>
<p class="verse">But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</p>
<p class="verse">And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</p>
<p class="verse">For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.</p>
<p class="verse">What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?</p>
<p class="verse">He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?</p>
<p class="verse">Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth.</p>
<p class="verse">Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.</p>
<p class="verse">Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</p>
<p class="verse">As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.</p>
<p class="verse">Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.</p>
<p class="verse">For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,</p>
<p class="verse">Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
<p class="verse">I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,</p>
<p class="verse">That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.</p>
<p class="verse">For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:</p>
<p class="verse">Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;</p>
<p class="verse">Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:</p>
<p class="verse">Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.</p>
<p class="verse">That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.</p>
<p class="verse">For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.</p>
<p class="verse">And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;</p>
<p class="verse">(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)</p>
<p class="verse">It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.</p>
<p class="verse">As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.</p>
<p class="verse">What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.</p>
<p class="verse">For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.</p>
<p class="verse">So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.</p>
<p class="verse">For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?</p>
<p class="verse">Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?</p>
<p class="verse">Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?</p>
<p class="verse">What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:</p>
<p class="verse">And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,</p>
<p class="verse">Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?</p>
<p class="verse">As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.</p>
<p class="verse">Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:</p>
<p class="verse">For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.</p>
<p class="verse">What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.</p>
<p class="verse">But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;</p>
<p class="verse">As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.</p>

<p class="verse">Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.</p>
<p class="verse">For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse">For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.</p>
<p class="verse">For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.</p>
<p class="verse">For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.</p>
<p class="verse">But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)</p>
<p class="verse">Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)</p>
<p class="verse">But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;</p>
<p class="verse">That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.</p>
<p class="verse">For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</p>
<p class="verse">For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.</p>
<p class="verse">For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.</p>
<p class="verse">For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</p>
<p class="verse">How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?</p>
<p class="verse">And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!</p>
<p class="verse">But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?</p>
<p class="verse">So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</p>
<p class="verse">But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.</p>
<p class="verse">But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you.</p>
<p class="verse">But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.</p>
<p class="verse">But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-romans-11">
<h3>Chapter 11</h3>
<p class="verse">I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</p>
<p class="verse">God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</p>
<p class="verse">But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.</p>
<p class="verse">Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</p>
<p class="verse">And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.</p>
<p class="verse">What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.</p>
<p class="verse">(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse">And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:</p>
<p class="verse">Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.</p>
<p class="verse">I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.</p>
<p class="verse">Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?</p>
<p class="verse">For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:</p>
<p class="verse">If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.</p>
<p class="verse">For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?</p>
<p class="verse">For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.</p>
<p class="verse">And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;</p>
<p class="verse">Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.</p>
<p class="verse">Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:</p>
<p class="verse">For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.</p>
<p class="verse">And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.</p>
<p class="verse">For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?</p>
<p class="verse">For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.</p>
<p class="verse">And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:</p>
<p class="verse">For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.</p>
<p class="verse">As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sakes.</p>
<p class="verse">For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</p>
<p class="verse">For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:</p>
<p class="verse">Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.</p>
<p class="verse">For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.</p>
<p class="verse">O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!</p>
<p class="verse">For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?</p>
<p class="verse">Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?</p>
<p class="verse">For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-romans-12">
<h3>Chapter 12</h3>
<p class="verse">I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.</p>
<p class="verse">And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.</p>
<p class="verse">For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.</p>
<p class="verse">For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:</p>
<p class="verse">So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.</p>
<p class="verse">Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;</p>
<p class="verse">Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;</p>
<p class="verse">Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.</p>
<p class="verse">Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.</p>
<p class="verse">Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;</p>
<p class="verse">Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;</p>
<p class="verse">Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;</p>
<p class="verse">Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.</p>
<p class="verse">Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.</p>
<p class="verse">Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.</p>
<p class="verse">Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.</p>
<p class="verse">Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.</p>
<p class="verse">If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.</p>
<p class="verse">Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.</p>
<p class="verse">Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-romans-13">
<h3>Chapter 13</h3>
<p class="verse">Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.</p>
<p class="verse">For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:</p>
<p class="verse">For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.</p>
<p class="verse">For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God’s ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.</p>
<p class="verse">Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.</p>
<p class="verse">Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.</p>
<p class="verse">For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</p>
<p class="verse">Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.</p>
<p class="verse">And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.</p>
<p class="verse">The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.</p>
<p class="verse">Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.</p>
<p class="verse">But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.</p>

<h3>Chapter 14</h3>
<p class="verse">Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.</p>
<p class="verse">For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.</p>
<p class="verse">Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.</p>
<p class="verse">Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.</p>
<p class="verse">One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.</p>
<p class="verse">He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</p>
<p class="verse">For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.</p>
<p class="verse">For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.</p>
<p class="verse">For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.</p>
<p class="verse">But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</p>
<p class="verse">So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.</p>
<p class="verse">Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother’s way.</p>
<p class="verse">I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</p>
<p class="verse">But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.</p>
<p class="verse">Let not then your good be evil spoken of:</p>
<p class="verse">For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse">For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men.</p>
<p class="verse">Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.</p>
<p class="verse">For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.</p>
<p class="verse">It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.</p>
<p class="verse">Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.</p>
<p class="verse">And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-romans-15">
<h3>Chapter 15</h3>
<p class="verse">We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</p>
<p class="verse">Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification.</p>
<p class="verse">For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.</p>
<p class="verse">For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:</p>
<p class="verse">That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:</p>
<p class="verse">And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.</p>
<p class="verse">And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.</p>
<p class="verse">And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.</p>
<p class="verse">And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse">And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,</p>
<p class="verse">That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse">I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.</p>
<p class="verse">For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,</p>
<p class="verse">Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man’s foundation:</p>
<p class="verse">But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.</p>
<p class="verse">For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.</p>
<p class="verse">But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;</p>
<p class="verse">Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.</p>
<p class="verse">But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.</p>
<p class="verse">For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.</p>
<p class="verse">When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.</p>
<p class="verse">And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ’s sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;</p>
<p class="verse">That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;</p>
<p class="verse">That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse">Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,</p>
<p class="verse">According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:</p>
<p class="verse">Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.</p>
<p class="verse">And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;</p>
<p class="verse">And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;</p>
<p class="verse">And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.</p>
<p class="verse">For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:</p>
<p class="verse">For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;</p>
<p class="verse">Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.</p>
<p class="verse">For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.</p>
<p class="verse">For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</p>
<p class="verse">And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.</p>
<p class="verse">We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:</p>
<p class="verse">Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.</p>
<p class="verse">For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 peter-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.</p>
<p class="verse">And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.</p>
<p class="verse">And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.</p>
<p class="verse">For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;</p>
<p class="verse">And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;</p>
<p class="verse">And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;</p>
<p class="verse">And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:</p>
<p class="verse">(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)</p>
<p class="verse">The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:</p>
<p class="verse">But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.</p>
<p class="verse">Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;</p>
<p class="verse">And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;</p>
<p class="verse">Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:</p>
<p class="verse">Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;</p>
<p class="verse">But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man’s voice forbad the madness of the prophet.</p>
<p class="verse">These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.</p>
<p class="verse">While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.</p>
<p class="verse">For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.</p>
<p class="verse">For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:</p>
<p class="verse">That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:</p>
<p class="verse">Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,</p>
<p class="verse">And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.</p>
<p class="verse">For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:</p>
<p class="verse">Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:</p>
<p class="verse">But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</p>
<p class="verse">But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</p>
<p class="verse">The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</p>
<p class="verse">But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.</p>
<p class="verse">Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,</p>
<p class="verse">Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.</p>
<p class="verse">And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;</p>
<p class="verse">As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.</p>
<p class="verse">But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;</p>
<p class="verse">(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)</p>
<p class="verse">That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.</p>
<p class="verse">This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.</p>
<p class="verse">If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:</p>
<p class="verse">But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.</p>
<p class="verse">If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.</p>
<p class="verse">If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</p>
<p class="verse">If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 john-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:</p>
<p class="verse">And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.</p>
<p class="verse">And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.</p>
<p class="verse">He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.</p>
<p class="verse">But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.</p>
<p class="verse">He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.</p>
<p class="verse">Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.</p>
<p class="verse">Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.</p>
<p class="verse">He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.</p>
<p class="verse">He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.</p>
<p class="verse">But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.</p>
<p class="verse">I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake.</p>
<p class="verse">I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.</p>
<p class="verse">I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.</p>
<p class="verse">Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</p>
<p class="verse">For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.</p>
<p class="verse">And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.</p>
<p class="verse">They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.</p>
<p class="verse">But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.</p>
<p class="verse">I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.</p>
<p class="verse">Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.</p>
<p class="verse">Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.</p>
<p class="verse">And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse">These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you.</p>
<p class="verse">But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.</p>
<p class="verse">And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.</p>
<p class="verse">If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 john-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.</p>
<p class="verse">Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.</p>
<p class="verse">And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.</p>
<p class="verse">Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.</p>
<p class="verse">Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.</p>
<p class="verse">Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.</p>
<p class="verse">He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</p>
<p class="verse">Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</p>
<p class="verse">In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.</p>
<p class="verse">For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.</p>
<p class="verse">Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother’s righteous.</p>
<p class="verse">Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.</p>
<p class="verse">We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.</p>
<p class="verse">Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.</p>
<p class="verse">Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</p>
<p class="verse">But whoso hath this world’s good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</p>
<p class="verse">My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.</p>
<p class="verse">And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.</p>
<p class="verse">For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.</p>
<p class="verse">Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.</p>
<p class="verse">And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.</p>
<p class="verse">And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.</p>
<p class="verse">And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 john-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.</p>
<p class="verse">Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:</p>
<p class="verse">And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.</p>
<p class="verse">They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.</p>
<p class="verse">We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.</p>
<p class="verse">Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.</p>
<p class="verse">He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.</p>
<p class="verse">In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.</p>
<p class="verse">Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.</p>
<p class="verse">Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.</p>
<p class="verse">No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.</p>
<p class="verse">Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse">And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.</p>
<p class="verse">Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.</p>
<p class="verse">And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.</p>
<p class="verse">Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.</p>
<p class="verse">There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.</p>
<p class="verse">We love him, because he first loved us.</p>
<p class="verse">If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?</p>
<p class="verse">And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 john-5">
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.</p>
<p class="verse">By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.</p>
<p class="verse">For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.</p>
<p class="verse">For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.</p>
<p class="verse">Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?</p>
<p class="verse">This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.</p>
<p class="verse">For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.</p>
<p class="verse">And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.</p>
<p class="verse">If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.</p>
<p class="verse">He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.</p>
<p class="verse">And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</p>
<p class="verse">He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.</p>
<p class="verse">These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:</p>
<p class="verse">And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.</p>
<p class="verse">If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.</p>
<p class="verse">All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.</p>
<p class="verse">We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.</p>
<p class="verse">And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.</p>
<p class="verse">And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse">Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called:</p>
<p class="verse">Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.</p>
<p class="verse">Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.</p>
<p class="verse">For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.</p>
<p class="verse">And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.</p>
<p class="verse">Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.</p>
<p class="verse">But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.</p>
<p class="verse">Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.</p>
<p class="verse">These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;</p>
<p class="verse">Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,</p>
<p class="verse">To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.</p>
<p class="verse">These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men’s persons in admiration because of advantage.</p>
<p class="verse">But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;</p>
<p class="verse">How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.</p>
<p class="verse">These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse">But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,</p>
<p class="verse">Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse">And of some have compassion, making a difference:</p>
<p class="verse">And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.</p>
<p class="verse">Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,</p>
<p class="verse">To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.</p>
