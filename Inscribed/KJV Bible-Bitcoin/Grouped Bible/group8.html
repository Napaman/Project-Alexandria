<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.</p>
<p class="verse">(There are eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them;</p>
<p class="verse">After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:</p>
<p class="verse">On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:</p>
<p class="verse">Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.</p>
<p class="verse">And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.</p>
<p class="verse">(The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)</p>
<p class="verse">How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?</p>
<p class="verse">Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.</p>
<p class="verse">So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.</p>
<p class="verse">And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God’s: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.</p>
<p class="verse">And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.</p>
<p class="verse">And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.</p>
<p class="verse">And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.</p>
<p class="verse">And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:</p>
<p class="verse">And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.</p>
<p class="verse">And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.</p>
<p class="verse">Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:</p>
<p class="verse">And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</p>
<p class="verse">Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.</p>
<p class="verse">Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;</p>
<p class="verse">And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,</p>
<p class="verse">Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,</p>
<p class="verse">Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.</p>
<p class="verse">But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.</p>
<p class="verse">But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.</p>
<p class="verse">Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.</p>
<p class="verse">So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-deuteronomy-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.</p>
<p class="verse">And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:</p>
<p class="verse">Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.</p>
<p class="verse">For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.</p>
<p class="verse">And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.</p>
<p class="verse">The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;</p>
<p class="verse">Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.</p>
<p class="verse">The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.</p>
<p class="verse">And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.</p>
<p class="verse">So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,</p>
<p class="verse">That the LORD spake unto me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:</p>
<p class="verse">And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.</p>
<p class="verse">(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;</p>
<p class="verse">A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:</p>
<p class="verse">As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:</p>
<p class="verse">And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)</p>
<p class="verse">Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.</p>
<p class="verse">This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;</p>
<p class="verse">(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.</p>
<p class="verse">But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.</p>
<p class="verse">And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:</p>
<p class="verse">Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.</p>
<p class="verse">From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:</p>
<p class="verse">Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-deuteronomy-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.</p>
<p class="verse">So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.</p>
<p class="verse">And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</p>
<p class="verse">All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.</p>
<p class="verse">And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.</p>
<p class="verse">But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.</p>
<p class="verse">And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;</p>
<p class="verse">(Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)</p>
<p class="verse">All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</p>
<p class="verse">For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.</p>
<p class="verse">And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.</p>
<p class="verse">And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.</p>
<p class="verse">Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse">And I gave Gilead unto Machir.</p>
<p class="verse">And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;</p>
<p class="verse">The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.</p>
<p class="verse">And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.</p>
<p class="verse">But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;</p>
<p class="verse">Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.</p>
<p class="verse">And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.</p>
<p class="verse">And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?</p>
<p class="verse">I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse">But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.</p>
<p class="verse">Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse">But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.</p>
<p class="verse">So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-deuteronomy-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.</p>
<p class="verse">Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you.</p>
<p class="verse">But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.</p>
<p class="verse">Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.</p>
<p class="verse">For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for?</p>
<p class="verse">And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?</p>
<p class="verse">Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons’ sons;</p>
<p class="verse">Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice.</p>
<p class="verse">And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.</p>
<p class="verse">Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:</p>
<p class="verse">Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,</p>
<p class="verse">The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,</p>
<p class="verse">The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:</p>
<p class="verse">And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day.</p>
<p class="verse">Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:</p>
<p class="verse">But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.</p>
<p class="verse">Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.</p>
<p class="verse">For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.</p>
<p class="verse">When thou shalt beget children, and children’s children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger:</p>
<p class="verse">I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you.</p>
<p class="verse">And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.</p>
<p class="verse">But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.</p>
<p class="verse">When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice;</p>
<p class="verse">(For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?</p>
<p class="verse">Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?</p>
<p class="verse">Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?</p>
<p class="verse">Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he is God; there is none else beside him.</p>
<p class="verse">Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.</p>
<p class="verse">And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;</p>
<p class="verse">To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day.</p>
<p class="verse">Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;</p>
<p class="verse">That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:</p>
<p class="verse">Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.</p>
<p class="verse">And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:</p>
<p class="verse">These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they came forth out of Egypt,</p>
<p class="verse">On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of Egypt:</p>
<p class="verse">And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;</p>
<p class="verse">From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which is Hermon,</p>
<p class="verse">And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire,</p>
<p class="verse">(I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to shew you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,</p>
<p class="verse">I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt have none other gods before me.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth:</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,</p>
<p class="verse">And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.</p>
<p class="verse">Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work:</p>
<p class="verse">But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou.</p>
<p class="verse">And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.</p>
<p class="verse">Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt not kill.</p>
<p class="verse">Neither shalt thou commit adultery.</p>
<p class="verse">Neither shalt thou steal.</p>
<p class="verse">Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.</p>
<p class="verse">Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour’s wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour’s house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbour’s.</p>
<p class="verse">These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;</p>
<p class="verse">And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die.</p>
<p class="verse">For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?</p>
<p class="verse">Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say: and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken.</p>
<p class="verse">O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!</p>
<p class="verse">Go say to them, Get you into your tents again.</p>
<p class="verse">But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.</p>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse">Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it:</p>
<p class="verse">That thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son’s son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.</p>
<p class="verse">Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey.</p>
<p class="verse">Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.</p>
<p class="verse">And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart:</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst not,</p>
<p class="verse">And houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full;</p>
<p class="verse">Then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which are round about you;</p>
<p class="verse">(For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in Massah.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers,</p>
<p class="verse">To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath spoken.</p>
<p class="verse">And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD our God hath commanded you?</p>
<p class="verse">Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh’s bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand:</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes:</p>
<p class="verse">And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is at this day.</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="verse">When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;</p>
<p class="verse">And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:</p>
<p class="verse">Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.</p>
<p class="verse">For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.</p>
<p class="verse">But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.</p>
<p class="verse">For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people:</p>
<p class="verse">But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse">Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;</p>
<p class="verse">And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers:</p>
<p class="verse">And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse">If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;</p>
<p class="verse">The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is among you, a mighty God and terrible.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.</p>
<p class="verse">But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.</p>
<p class="verse">The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein: for it is an abomination to the LORD thy God.</p>
<p class="verse">Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="verse">All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no.</p>
<p class="verse">And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.</p>
<p class="verse">Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.</p>
<p class="verse">For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;</p>
<p class="verse">A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;</p>
<p class="verse">A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.</p>
<p class="verse">When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day:</p>
<p class="verse">Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein;</p>
<p class="verse">And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;</p>
<p class="verse">Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage;</p>
<p class="verse">Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;</p>
<p class="verse">Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end;</p>
<p class="verse">And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth.</p>
<p class="verse">But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.</p>
<p class="verse">As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the LORD your God.</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
<p class="verse">Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to heaven,</p>
<p class="verse">A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the children of Anak!</p>
<p class="verse">Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</p>
<p class="verse">Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people.</p>
<p class="verse">Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.</p>
<p class="verse">When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.</p>
<p class="verse">Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:</p>
<p class="verse">Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.</p>
<p class="verse">So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.</p>
<p class="verse">And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.</p>
<p class="verse">And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.</p>
<p class="verse">And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.</p>
<p class="verse">For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.</p>
<p class="verse">And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.</p>
<p class="verse">And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.</p>
<p class="verse">I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.</p>
<p class="verse">Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:</p>
<p class="verse">Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.</p>

<h3>Chapter 10</h3>
<p class="verse">At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.</p>
<p class="verse">And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me.</p>
<p class="verse">And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.</p>
<p class="verse">And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s office in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse">From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.</p>
<p class="verse">At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised him.</p>
<p class="verse">And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also, and the LORD would not destroy thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,</p>
<p class="verse">To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD’s thy God, the earth also, with all that therein is.</p>
<p class="verse">Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day.</p>
<p class="verse">Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked.</p>
<p class="verse">For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward:</p>
<p class="verse">He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.</p>
<p class="verse">Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.</p>
<p class="verse">He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.</p>
<p class="verse">Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.</p>

<p class="verse">And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;</p>
<p class="verse">And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this day;</p>
<p class="verse">And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this place;</p>
<p class="verse">And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel:</p>
<p class="verse">But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it;</p>
<p class="verse">And that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey.</p>
<p class="verse">For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs:</p>
<p class="verse">But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven:</p>
<p class="verse">A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,</p>
<p class="verse">That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full.</p>
<p class="verse">Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;</p>
<p class="verse">And then the LORD’s wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates:</p>
<p class="verse">That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him;</p>
<p class="verse">Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves.</p>
<p class="verse">Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.</p>
<p class="verse">There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;</p>
<p class="verse">A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day:</p>
<p class="verse">And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.</p>
<p class="verse">Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?</p>
<p class="verse">For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-deuteronomy-12">
<h3>Chapter 12</h3>
<p class="verse">These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to do in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse">But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come:</p>
<p class="verse">And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks:</p>
<p class="verse">And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.</p>
<p class="verse">For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God giveth you.</p>
<p class="verse">But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety;</p>
<p class="verse">Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD:</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you.</p>
<p class="verse">Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest:</p>
<p class="verse">But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.</p>
<p class="verse">Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offerings, or heave offering of thine hand:</p>
<p class="verse">But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands unto.</p>
<p class="verse">Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.</p>
<p class="verse">If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.</p>
<p class="verse">Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.</p>
<p class="verse">Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose:</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh.</p>
<p class="verse">Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thy God.</p>
<p class="verse">When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their land;</p>
<p class="verse">Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.</p>
<p class="verse">What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.</p>

<p class="verse">Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him.</p>
<p class="verse">And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which the LORD thy God commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee.</p>

<p class="verse">Then shalt thou enquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought among you;</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again.</p>
<p class="verse">And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand: that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and shew thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers;</p>

<p class="verse">For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the LORD hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above all the nations that are upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.</p>
<p class="verse">These are the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,</p>
<p class="verse">The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois.</p>
<p class="verse">And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft into two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye shall eat.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore they are unclean unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcase.</p>
<p class="verse">These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall ye eat:</p>
<p class="verse">And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it is unclean unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">Of all clean birds ye shall eat.</p>
<p class="verse">But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,</p>

<p class="verse">And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you: they shall not be eaten.</p>
<p class="verse">But of all clean fowls ye may eat.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself: thou shalt give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother’s milk.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the field bringeth forth year by year.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always.</p>
<p class="verse">And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which the LORD thy God shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:</p>

<p class="verse">At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.</p>
<p class="verse">And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it; he shall not exact it of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it is called the LORD’s release.</p>
<p class="verse">Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release;</p>
<p class="verse">Save when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall greatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it:</p>
<p class="verse">Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day.</p>
<p class="verse">For the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.</p>
<p class="verse">If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother:</p>
<p class="verse">But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.</p>
<p class="verse">Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry unto the LORD against thee, and it be sin unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto.</p>
<p class="verse">For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.</p>
<p class="verse">And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty:</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy winepress: of that wherewith the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this thing to day.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with thee;</p>
<p class="verse">Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust it through his ear unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise.</p>
<p class="verse">It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away free from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant to thee, in serving thee six years: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all that thou doest.</p>
<p class="verse">All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the firstling of thy sheep.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the place which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household.</p>
<p class="verse">And if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or blind, or have any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the LORD thy God.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.</p>

<p class="verse">Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.</p>
<p class="verse">And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh, which thou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee:</p>

<p class="verse">Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons, neither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.</p>
<p class="verse">That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live, and inherit the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the altar of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make thee.</p>

<p class="verse">But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.</p>
<p class="verse">Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites:</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them:</p>
<p class="verse">That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.</p>

<p class="verse">The priests the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi, shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and his inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren: the LORD is their inheritance, as he hath said unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">And this shall be the priest’s due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep; and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.</p>
<p class="verse">The firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.</p>
<p class="verse">For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the LORD shall choose;</p>
<p class="verse">Then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, which stand there before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony.</p>
<p class="verse">When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.</p>

<p class="verse">Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.</p>

<p class="verse">The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken;</p>
<p class="verse">According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto me, They have well spoken that which they have spoken.</p>
<p class="verse">I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.</p>
<p class="verse">But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.</p>

<h3>Chapter 19</h3>
<p class="verse">When the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations, whose land the LORD thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their cities, and in their houses;</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer may flee thither.</p>
<p class="verse">And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past;</p>
<p class="verse">As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of those cities, and live:</p>
<p class="verse">Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities for thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers;</p>
<p class="verse">If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, beside these three:</p>
<p class="verse">That innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee.</p>
<p class="verse">But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and fleeth into one of these cities:</p>
<p class="verse">Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.</p>
<p class="verse">Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour’s landmark, which they of old time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.</p>
<p class="verse">One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.</p>
<p class="verse">If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong;</p>
<p class="verse">Then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges, which shall be in those days;</p>
<p class="verse">And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely against his brother;</p>
<p class="verse">Then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you.</p>
<p class="verse">And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you.</p>

<p class="verse">And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people,</p>
<p class="verse">And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them;</p>
<p class="verse">For the LORD your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.</p>
<p class="verse">And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.</p>
<p class="verse">And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not yet eaten of it? let him also go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it.</p>
<p class="verse">And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.</p>
<p class="verse">And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren’s heart faint as well as his heart.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people, that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people.</p>
<p class="verse">When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it:</p>
<p class="verse">And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword:</p>
<p class="verse">But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.</p>
<p class="verse">But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth:</p>
<p class="verse">But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee:</p>
<p class="verse">That they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse">When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field is man’s life) to employ them in the siege:</p>
<p class="verse">Only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it be subdued.</p>

<p class="verse">If one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath slain him:</p>
<p class="verse">Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain:</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall be, that the city which is next unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke;</p>
<p class="verse">And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer’s neck there in the valley:</p>
<p class="verse">And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried:</p>
<p class="verse">And all the elders of that city, that are next unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley:</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.</p>
<p class="verse">Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel’s charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them.</p>
<p class="verse">So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the LORD thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them captive,</p>
<p class="verse">And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife;</p>

<p class="verse">And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her.</p>
<p class="verse">If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated:</p>
<p class="verse">Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, which is indeed the firstborn:</p>
<p class="verse">But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath: for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.</p>
<p class="verse">If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them:</p>
<p class="verse">Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.</p>
<p class="verse">And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree:</p>
<p class="verse">His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.</p>

<p class="verse">In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his raiment; and with all lost thing of thy brother’s, which he hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise: thou mayest not hide thyself.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt not see thy brother’s ass or his ox fall down by the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again.</p>

<p class="verse">And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him;</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver, and give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.</p>
<p class="verse">But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel:</p>
<p class="verse">Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father’s house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you.</p>

<p class="verse">But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die:</p>
<p class="verse">But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this matter:</p>

<p class="verse">If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;</p>

<p class="verse">And it shall be, that the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead, that his name be not put out of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And if the man like not to take his brother’s wife, then let his brother’s wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband’s brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband’s brother.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and if he stand to it, and say, I like not to take her;</p>
<p class="verse">Then shall his brother’s wife come unto him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother’s house.</p>
<p class="verse">And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that hath his shoe loosed.</p>
<p class="verse">When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets:</p>
<p class="verse">Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity her.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a small.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great and a small.</p>
<p class="verse">But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.</p>
<p class="verse">For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteously, are an abomination unto the LORD thy God.</p>
<p class="verse">Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were come forth out of Egypt;</p>
<p class="verse">How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary; and he feared not God.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget it.</p>

<p class="verse">And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest it, and dwellest therein;</p>
<p class="verse">That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth, which thou shalt bring of thy land that the LORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name there.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days, and say unto him, I profess this day unto the LORD thy God, that I am come unto the country which the LORD sware unto our fathers for to give us.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and set it down before the altar of the LORD thy God.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous:</p>
<p class="verse">And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage:</p>
<p class="verse">And when we cried unto the LORD God of our fathers, the LORD heard our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our labour, and our oppression:</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders:</p>
<p class="verse">And he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, even a land that floweth with milk and honey.</p>
<p class="verse">And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land, which thou, O LORD, hast given me. And thou shalt set it before the LORD thy God, and worship before the LORD thy God:</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the LORD thy God hath given unto thee, and unto thine house, thou, and the Levite, and the stranger that is among you.</p>
<p class="verse">When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and hast given it unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled;</p>
<p class="verse">Then thou shalt say before the LORD thy God, I have brought away the hallowed things out of mine house, and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me: I have not transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them:</p>
<p class="verse">I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away ought thereof for any unclean use, nor given ought thereof for the dead: but I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God, and have done according to all that thou hast commanded me.</p>
<p class="verse">Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou swarest unto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey.</p>
<p class="verse">This day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments: thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God, and to walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken unto his voice:</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments;</p>
<p class="verse">And to make thee high above all nations which he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honour; and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the LORD thy God, as he hath spoken.</p>

<p class="verse">And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandments which I command you this day.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt set thee up great stones, and plaister them with plaister:</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when thou art passed over, that thou mayest go in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, a land that floweth with milk and honey; as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan, that ye shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaister them with plaister.</p>
<p class="verse">And there shalt thou build an altar unto the LORD thy God, an altar of stones: thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole stones: and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD thy God:</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt offer peace offerings, and shalt eat there, and rejoice before the LORD thy God.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel, saying, Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art become the people of the LORD thy God.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the LORD thy God, and do his commandments and his statutes, which I command thee this day.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses charged the people the same day, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when ye are come over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin:</p>
<p class="verse">And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice,</p>
<p class="verse">Cursed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image, an abomination unto the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and putteth it in a secret place. And all the people shall answer and say, Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">Cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour’s landmark. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">Cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger, fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">Cursed be he that lieth with his father’s wife; because he uncovereth his father’s skirt. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">Cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">Cursed be he that lieth with his mother in law. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbour secretly. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>

<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that the LORD thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth:</p>
<p class="verse">And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face: they shall come out against thee one way, and flee before thee seven ways.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses, and in all that thou settest thine hand unto; and he shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD shall establish thee an holy people unto himself, as he hath sworn unto thee, if thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, and walk in his ways.</p>
<p class="verse">And all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD shall make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers to give thee.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD shall open unto thee his good treasure, the heaven to give the rain unto thy land in his season, and to bless all the work of thine hand: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, and thou shalt not borrow.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the LORD thy God, which I command thee this day, to observe and to do them:</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.</p>
<p class="verse">But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee:</p>
<p class="verse">Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field.</p>
<p class="verse">Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store.</p>
<p class="verse">Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.</p>
<p class="verse">Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do, until thou be destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; because of the wickedness of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he have consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest to possess it.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue thee until thou perish.</p>
<p class="verse">And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the earth that is under thee shall be iron.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies: thou shalt go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before them: and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">And thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air, and unto the beasts of the earth, and no man shall fray them away.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with the emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou canst not be healed.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart:</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore, and no man shall save thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: thou shalt build an house, and thou shalt not dwell therein: thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat thereof: thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face, and shall not be restored to thee: thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to rescue them.</p>
<p class="verse">Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people, and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day long: and there shall be no might in thine hand:</p>
<p class="verse">The fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway:</p>
<p class="verse">So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set over thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known; and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations whither the LORD shall lead thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather but little in; for the locust shall consume it.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress them, but shalt neither drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall eat them.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive shall cast his fruit.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy them; for they shall go into captivity.</p>
<p class="verse">All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume.</p>
<p class="verse">The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high; and thou shalt come down very low.</p>
<p class="verse">He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee:</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things;</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand;</p>
<p class="verse">A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old, nor shew favour to the young:</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land, until thou be destroyed: which also shall not leave thee either corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy sheep, until he have destroyed thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, which the LORD thy God hath given thee, in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee:</p>
<p class="verse">So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave:</p>
<p class="verse">So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates.</p>
<p class="verse">The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,</p>
<p class="verse">And toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.</p>
<p class="verse">If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD;</p>
<p class="verse">Then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the LORD thy God.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and stone.</p>
<p class="verse">And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:</p>
<p class="verse">And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life:</p>
<p class="verse">In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.</p>

<h3>Chapter 29</h3>
<p class="verse">These are the words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land;</p>
<p class="verse">The great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and those great miracles:</p>
<p class="verse">Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse">And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink: that ye might know that I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse">And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them:</p>
<p class="verse">And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh.</p>
<p class="verse">Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the men of Israel,</p>
<p class="verse">Your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that is in thy camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water:</p>
<p class="verse">That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the LORD thy God, and into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this day:</p>
<p class="verse">That he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto thee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</p>
<p class="verse">Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;</p>
<p class="verse">But with him that standeth here with us this day before the LORD our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day:</p>
<p class="verse">(For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came through the nations which ye passed by;</p>
<p class="verse">And ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them:)</p>
<p class="verse">Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood;</p>
<p class="verse">And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst:</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law:</p>
<p class="verse">So that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon it;</p>
<p class="verse">And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:</p>
<p class="verse">Even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger?</p>
<p class="verse">Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt:</p>
<p class="verse">For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them:</p>
<p class="verse">And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day.</p>
<p class="verse">The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.</p>

<p class="verse">That then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee.</p>
<p class="verse">If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven, from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee:</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.</p>

<p class="verse">If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law, and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.</p>
<p class="verse">For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off.</p>
<p class="verse">It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?</p>
<p class="verse">Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?</p>
<p class="verse">But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.</p>
<p class="verse">See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;</p>
<p class="verse">In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it.</p>
<p class="verse">But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;</p>
<p class="verse">I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.</p>
<p class="verse">I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:</p>
<p class="verse">That thou mayest love the LORD thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.</p>

<h3>Chapter 31</h3>
<p class="verse">And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them: and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD hath said.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you.</p>
<p class="verse">Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,</p>
<p class="verse">When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.</p>
<p class="verse">Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law:</p>
<p class="verse">And that their children, which have not known any thing, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.</p>
<p class="verse">Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God is not among us?</p>
<p class="verse">And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware.</p>
<p class="verse">Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,</p>
<p class="verse">That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.</p>
<p class="verse">For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death?</p>
<p class="verse">Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.</p>
<p class="verse">For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-deuteronomy-32">
<h3>Chapter 32</h3>
<p class="verse">Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse">My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass:</p>
<p class="verse">Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye greatness unto our God.</p>
<p class="verse">He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.</p>
<p class="verse">They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.</p>
<p class="verse">Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?</p>
<p class="verse">Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.</p>
<p class="verse">When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">For the LORD’s portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse">He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.</p>
<p class="verse">As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:</p>
<p class="verse">So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.</p>
<p class="verse">He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;</p>
<p class="verse">Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.</p>
<p class="verse">They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger.</p>
<p class="verse">They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith.</p>
<p class="verse">They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.</p>
<p class="verse">For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.</p>
<p class="verse">I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.</p>
<p class="verse">They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.</p>
<p class="verse">The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.</p>
<p class="verse">I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:</p>
<p class="verse">Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all this.</p>
<p class="verse">For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them.</p>
<p class="verse">O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!</p>
<p class="verse">How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?</p>
<p class="verse">For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.</p>
<p class="verse">For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:</p>
<p class="verse">Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.</p>
<p class="verse">Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures?</p>
<p class="verse">To me belongeth vengeance, and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.</p>
<p class="verse">For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,</p>
<p class="verse">Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.</p>
<p class="verse">See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.</p>
<p class="verse">For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.</p>
<p class="verse">I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.</p>
<p class="verse">Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.</p>
<p class="verse">For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:</p>
<p class="verse">And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:</p>
<p class="verse">Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-deuteronomy-33">
<h3>Chapter 33</h3>
<p class="verse">And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words.</p>
<p class="verse">Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.</p>
<p class="verse">And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together.</p>
<p class="verse">Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.</p>
<p class="verse">And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from his enemies.</p>
<p class="verse">And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;</p>
<p class="verse">Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.</p>
<p class="verse">They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar.</p>
<p class="verse">Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands: smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.</p>
<p class="verse">And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.</p>
<p class="verse">And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath,</p>
<p class="verse">And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon,</p>
<p class="verse">And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills,</p>
<p class="verse">And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren.</p>
<p class="verse">His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.</p>
<p class="verse">And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and, Issachar, in thy tents.</p>
<p class="verse">They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.</p>
<p class="verse">And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.</p>
<p class="verse">And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion’s whelp: he shall leap from Bashan.</p>
<p class="verse">And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west and the south.</p>
<p class="verse">And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.</p>
<p class="verse">Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy strength be.</p>
<p class="verse">There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.</p>
<p class="verse">The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy them.</p>
<p class="verse">Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew.</p>
<p class="verse">Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-deuteronomy-34">
<h3>Chapter 34</h3>
<p class="verse">And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,</p>
<p class="verse">And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,</p>
<p class="verse">And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.</p>
<p class="verse">So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.</p>
<p class="verse">And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.</p>
<p class="verse">And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse">And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,</p>
<p class="verse">In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,</p>
<p class="verse">And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom, departing from the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.</p>
<p class="verse">And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said unto him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.</p>
<p class="verse">But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.</p>
<p class="verse">Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God.</p>
<p class="verse">Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-hosea-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.</p>
<p class="verse">Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;</p>
<p class="verse">Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the children of whoredoms.</p>
<p class="verse">For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.</p>
<p class="verse">And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.</p>
<p class="verse">For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness.</p>
<p class="verse">And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.</p>
<p class="verse">I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.</p>
<p class="verse">For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.</p>
<p class="verse">And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.</p>
<p class="verse">I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;</p>
<p class="verse">And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine.</p>
<p class="verse">So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:</p>
<p class="verse">And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another man: so will I also be for thee.</p>
<p class="verse">For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.</p>
<p class="verse">By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are as they that strive with the priest.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.</p>
<p class="verse">My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.</p>
<p class="verse">As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will I change their glory into shame.</p>
<p class="verse">They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse">And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.</p>
<p class="verse">For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.</p>
<p class="verse">My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.</p>
<p class="verse">They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.</p>
<p class="verse">I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall.</p>
<p class="verse">Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.</p>
<p class="verse">For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.</p>
<p class="verse">Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.</p>
<p class="verse">Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers with shame do love, Give ye.</p>
<p class="verse">The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-hosea-5">
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment is toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.</p>
<p class="verse">And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I have been a rebuker of them all.</p>
<p class="verse">I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, and Israel is defiled.</p>
<p class="verse">They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them.</p>
<p class="verse">They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn himself from them.</p>
<p class="verse">They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions.</p>
<p class="verse">Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud at Bethaven, after thee, O Benjamin.</p>
<p class="verse">Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.</p>
<p class="verse">The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.</p>
<p class="verse">Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</p>
<p class="verse">When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.</p>
<p class="verse">For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue him.</p>
<p class="verse">I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-hosea-6">
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse">Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.</p>
<p class="verse">After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.</p>
<p class="verse">Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth.</p>
<p class="verse">For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.</p>
<p class="verse">But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.</p>
<p class="verse">Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with blood.</p>
<p class="verse">And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.</p>
<p class="verse">I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.</p>
<p class="verse">Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-hosea-7">
<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="verse">When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers spoileth without.</p>
<p class="verse">And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.</p>
<p class="verse">They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.</p>
<p class="verse">They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.</p>
<p class="verse">In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.</p>
<p class="verse">For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.</p>
<p class="verse">They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.</p>
<p class="verse">Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.</p>
<p class="verse">Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.</p>
<p class="verse">And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.</p>
<p class="verse">Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.</p>
<p class="verse">When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.</p>
<p class="verse">Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.</p>
<p class="verse">And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, and they rebel against me.</p>
<p class="verse">Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.</p>
<p class="verse">They return, but not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="verse">Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He shall come as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.</p>
<p class="verse">Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall pursue him.</p>
<p class="verse">They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.</p>
<p class="verse">Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?</p>
<p class="verse">For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.</p>
<p class="verse">For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.</p>
<p class="verse">Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure.</p>
<p class="verse">For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.</p>
<p class="verse">Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.</p>
<p class="verse">I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing.</p>
<p class="verse">They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse">For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
<p class="verse">Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as other people: for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor.</p>
<p class="verse">The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.</p>
<p class="verse">They shall not dwell in the LORD’s land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria.</p>
<p class="verse">They shall not offer wine offerings to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the LORD?</p>
<p class="verse">For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant places for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be in their tabernacles.</p>
<p class="verse">The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great hatred.</p>
<p class="verse">The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the house of his God.</p>
<p class="verse">They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.</p>
<p class="verse">I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time: but they went to Baalpeor, and separated themselves unto that shame; and their abominations were according as they loved.</p>
<p class="verse">As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.</p>
<p class="verse">Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, that there shall not be a man left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!</p>
<p class="verse">Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.</p>
<p class="verse">Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.</p>
<p class="verse">All their wickedness is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I will love them no more: all their princes are revolters.</p>
<p class="verse">Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb.</p>
<p class="verse">My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.</p>

<h3>Chapter 10</h3>
<p class="verse">Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images.</p>
<p class="verse">Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.</p>
<p class="verse">For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us?</p>
<p class="verse">They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.</p>
<p class="verse">The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.</p>
<p class="verse">It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.</p>
<p class="verse">As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water.</p>
<p class="verse">The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.</p>
<p class="verse">O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.</p>
<p class="verse">It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows.</p>
<p class="verse">And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread out the corn; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall break his clods.</p>
<p class="verse">Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children.</p>
<p class="verse">So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.</p>

<h3>Chapter 11</h3>
<p class="verse">When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse">As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.</p>
<p class="verse">I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.</p>
<p class="verse">I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return.</p>
<p class="verse">And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels.</p>
<p class="verse">And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt him.</p>
<p class="verse">How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.</p>
<p class="verse">I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.</p>
<p class="verse">They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west.</p>
<p class="verse">They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-hosea-12">
<h3>Chapter 12</h3>
<p class="verse">Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him.</p>
<p class="verse">He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God:</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him in Bethel, and there he spake with us;</p>
<p class="verse">Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD is his memorial.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually.</p>
<p class="verse">He is a merchant, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loveth to oppress.</p>
<p class="verse">And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out substance: in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that were sin.</p>
<p class="verse">And I that am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast.</p>
<p class="verse">I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse">Is there iniquity in Gilead? surely they are vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep.</p>
<p class="verse">And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved.</p>
<p class="verse">Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly: therefore shall he leave his blood upon him, and his reproach shall his LORD return unto him.</p>

<h3>Chapter 13</h3>
<p class="verse">When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.</p>
<p class="verse">And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, and idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet I am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no god but me: for there is no saviour beside me.</p>
<p class="verse">I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.</p>
<p class="verse">According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I observe them:</p>
<p class="verse">I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the caul of their heart, and there will I devour them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them.</p>
<p class="verse">O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me is thine help.</p>
<p class="verse">I will be thy king: where is any other that may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes?</p>
<p class="verse">I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took him away in my wrath.</p>
<p class="verse">The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid.</p>
<p class="verse">The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he is an unwise son; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children.</p>
<p class="verse">I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.</p>
<p class="verse">Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an east wind shall come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.</p>
<p class="verse">Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.</p>

<p class="verse">O Israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.</p>

<p class="verse">Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.</p>
<p class="verse">I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him.</p>
<p class="verse">I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse">His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse">They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse">Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard him, and observed him: I am like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit found.</p>
<p class="verse">Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD hath been sore displeased with your fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse">Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?</p>
<p class="verse">But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.</p>
<p class="verse">Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these be.</p>
<p class="verse">And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good words and comfortable words.</p>
<p class="verse">So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.</p>
<p class="verse">And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.</p>
<p class="verse">And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD shewed me four carpenters.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.</p>

<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?</p>
<p class="verse">Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.</p>
<p class="verse">And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.</p>
<p class="verse">And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by.</p>
<p class="verse">And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.</p>

<p class="verse">For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.</p>

<p class="verse">And two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.</p>

<p class="verse">Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse">Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.</p>

<p class="verse">And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.</p>

<p class="verse">Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it.</p>

<p class="verse">Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven.</p>

<p class="verse">The black horses which are therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country.</p>
<p class="verse">And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chisleu;</p>
<p class="verse">When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regemmelech, and their men, to pray before the LORD,</p>
<p class="verse">And to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?</p>
<p class="verse">Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me?</p>
<p class="verse">And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?</p>
<p class="verse">Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when men inhabited the south and the plain?</p>
<p class="verse">And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother:</p>
<p class="verse">And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.</p>
<p class="verse">But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts:</p>
<p class="verse">But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="verse">Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for very age.</p>
<p class="verse">And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith the LORD of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country;</p>
<p class="verse">And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, which were in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.</p>
<p class="verse">For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every one against his neighbour.</p>
<p class="verse">But now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the former days, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse">For the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass, that as ye were a curse among the heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing: fear not, but let your hands be strong.</p>
<p class="verse">For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of hosts, and I repented not:</p>
<p class="verse">So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.</p>
<p class="verse">These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates:</p>
<p class="verse">And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and peace.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities:</p>
<p class="verse">And the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts: I will go also.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard that God is with you.</p>

<p class="verse">As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water.</p>
<p class="verse">Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do I declare that I will render double unto thee;</p>

<p class="verse">Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle.</p>

<p class="verse">There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter;</p>

<p class="verse">And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.</p>
<p class="verse">Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another.</p>
<p class="verse">And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver.</p>

<p class="verse">For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.</p>
<p class="verse">Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.</p>
<p class="verse">And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal: yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and the LORD my God shall come, and all the saints with thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be clear, nor dark:</p>
<p class="verse">But it shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD, not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at evening time it shall be light.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one LORD, and his name one.</p>
<p class="verse">All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin’s gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel unto the king’s winepresses.</p>
<p class="verse">And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.</p>
<p class="verse">And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour.</p>
<p class="verse">And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance.</p>
<p class="verse">And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall be, that whoso will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain.</p>
<p class="verse">And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that have no rain; there shall be the plague, wherewith the LORD will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.</p>
<p class="verse">This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.</p>
<p class="verse">In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD’s house shall be like the bowls before the altar.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the LORD of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe therein: and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;</p>
<p class="verse">Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,</p>
<p class="verse">Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:</p>
<p class="verse">From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;</p>
<p class="verse">Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</p>
<p class="verse">But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;</p>
<p class="verse">Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</p>
<p class="verse">For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;</p>
<p class="verse">According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</p>
<p class="verse">And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;</p>
<p class="verse">Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</p>
<p class="verse">And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.</p>
<p class="verse">Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;</p>
<p class="verse">Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:</p>
<p class="verse">Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 timothy-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;</p>
<p class="verse">For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.</p>
<p class="verse">For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;</p>
<p class="verse">Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;</p>
<p class="verse">Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.</p>
<p class="verse">Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.</p>
<p class="verse">I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.</p>
<p class="verse">In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;</p>
<p class="verse">But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.</p>
<p class="verse">Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.</p>
<p class="verse">But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.</p>
<p class="verse">For Adam was first formed, then Eve.</p>
<p class="verse">And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.</p>
<p class="verse">Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 timothy-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.</p>
<p class="verse">A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;</p>
<p class="verse">Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;</p>
<p class="verse">One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;</p>
<p class="verse">(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)</p>
<p class="verse">Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;</p>
<p class="verse">Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</p>
<p class="verse">And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless.</p>
<p class="verse">Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.</p>
<p class="verse">Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.</p>
<p class="verse">For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:</p>
<p class="verse">But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 timothy-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;</p>
<p class="verse">Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;</p>
<p class="verse">Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:</p>
<p class="verse">For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</p>
<p class="verse">If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.</p>
<p class="verse">But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness.</p>
<p class="verse">For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</p>
<p class="verse">This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.</p>
<p class="verse">For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.</p>
<p class="verse">These things command and teach.</p>
<p class="verse">Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</p>
<p class="verse">Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse">Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.</p>
<p class="verse">Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.</p>
<p class="verse">Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 timothy-5">
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;</p>
<p class="verse">The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.</p>
<p class="verse">Honour widows that are widows indeed.</p>
<p class="verse">But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.</p>
<p class="verse">Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.</p>
<p class="verse">But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.</p>
<p class="verse">And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.</p>
<p class="verse">But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.</p>
<p class="verse">Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man,</p>
<p class="verse">Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints’ feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.</p>
<p class="verse">But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;</p>
<p class="verse">Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.</p>
<p class="verse">And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.</p>
<p class="verse">I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.</p>
<p class="verse">For some are already turned aside after Satan.</p>
<p class="verse">If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.</p>
<p class="verse">Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse">For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.</p>
<p class="verse">Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.</p>
<p class="verse">Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.</p>
<p class="verse">I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.</p>
<p class="verse">Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep thyself pure.</p>
<p class="verse">Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thine often infirmities.</p>
<p class="verse">Some men’s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 timothy-6">
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse">Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.</p>
<p class="verse">And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.</p>
<p class="verse">If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;</p>
<p class="verse">He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,</p>
<p class="verse">Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.</p>
<p class="verse">But godliness with contentment is great gain.</p>
<p class="verse">For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.</p>
<p class="verse">And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.</p>
<p class="verse">But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.</p>
<p class="verse">For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</p>
<p class="verse">But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.</p>
<p class="verse">Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.</p>
<p class="verse">I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;</p>
<p class="verse">That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse">Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;</p>
<p class="verse">Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;</p>
<p class="verse">That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;</p>
<p class="verse">Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse">O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:</p>
<p class="verse">Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,</p>
<p class="verse">To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;</p>
<p class="verse">Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</p>
<p class="verse">When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</p>
<p class="verse">For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</p>
<p class="verse">Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;</p>
<p class="verse">Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,</p>
<p class="verse">But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:</p>
<p class="verse">Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="verse">For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.</p>
<p class="verse">Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.</p>
<p class="verse">This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</p>
<p class="verse">The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:</p>
<p class="verse">But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me.</p>
<p class="verse">The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 timothy-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.</p>
<p class="verse">And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</p>
<p class="verse">The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.</p>
<p class="verse">Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</p>
<p class="verse">Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:</p>
<p class="verse">Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</p>
<p class="verse">It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:</p>
<p class="verse">If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:</p>
<p class="verse">If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.</p>
<p class="verse">Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.</p>
<p class="verse">Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</p>
<p class="verse">But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.</p>
<p class="verse">And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</p>
<p class="verse">Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse">But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.</p>
<p class="verse">If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, and prepared unto every good work.</p>
<p class="verse">Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p>
<p class="verse">But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.</p>
<p class="verse">And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,</p>
<p class="verse">In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;</p>
<p class="verse">And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 timothy-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</p>
<p class="verse">For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</p>
<p class="verse">Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</p>
<p class="verse">Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</p>
<p class="verse">Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</p>
<p class="verse">For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,</p>
<p class="verse">Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.</p>
<p class="verse">But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.</p>
<p class="verse">But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,</p>
<p class="verse">Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</p>
<p class="verse">But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</p>
<p class="verse">But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;</p>
<p class="verse">And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</p>
<p class="verse">That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 timothy-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;</p>
<p class="verse">Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse">For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.</p>
<p class="verse">But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.</p>
<p class="verse">For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</p>
<p class="verse">I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:</p>
<p class="verse">Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.</p>
<p class="verse">Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:</p>
<p class="verse">For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.</p>
<p class="verse">Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</p>
<p class="verse">And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.</p>
<p class="verse">The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.</p>
<p class="verse">Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:</p>
<p class="verse">Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.</p>
<p class="verse">At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.</p>
<p class="verse">Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.</p>
<p class="verse">Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.</p>
<p class="verse">Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</p>
<p class="verse">The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</p>
<p class="verse">In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;</p>
<p class="verse">But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</p>
<p class="verse">To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</p>
<p class="verse">For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</p>
<p class="verse">If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.</p>
<p class="verse">For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;</p>
<p class="verse">But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;</p>
<p class="verse">Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</p>
<p class="verse">For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:</p>
<p class="verse">Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.</p>
<p class="verse">One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.</p>
<p class="verse">This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</p>
<p class="verse">Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.</p>
<p class="verse">They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-titus-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:</p>
<p class="verse">That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.</p>
<p class="verse">The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;</p>
<p class="verse">That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,</p>
<p class="verse">To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</p>
<p class="verse">Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.</p>
<p class="verse">In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,</p>
<p class="verse">Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.</p>
<p class="verse">Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;</p>
<p class="verse">Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</p>
<p class="verse">For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,</p>
<p class="verse">Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;</p>
<p class="verse">Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</p>
<p class="verse">Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</p>
<p class="verse">These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-titus-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,</p>
<p class="verse">To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.</p>
<p class="verse">For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</p>
<p class="verse">But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,</p>
<p class="verse">Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</p>
<p class="verse">Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</p>
<p class="verse">That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse">This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</p>
<p class="verse">But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</p>
<p class="verse">A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;</p>
<p class="verse">Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.</p>
<p class="verse">When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.</p>
<p class="verse">Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</p>
<p class="verse">All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,</p>
<p class="verse">And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</p>
<p class="verse">Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</p>
<p class="verse">Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</p>
<p class="verse">That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</p>
<p class="verse">Yet for love’s sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</p>
<p class="verse">Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</p>
<p class="verse">Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</p>
<p class="verse">Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</p>
<p class="verse">But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</p>
<p class="verse">For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</p>
<p class="verse">Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</p>
<p class="verse">If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</p>
<p class="verse">If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;</p>
<p class="verse">I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</p>
<p class="verse">But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</p>
<p class="verse">Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</p>
<p class="verse">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;</p>
<p class="verse">For the truth’s sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</p>
<p class="verse">I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.</p>
<p class="verse">And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</p>
<p class="verse">And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.</p>
<p class="verse">For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.</p>
<p class="verse">Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.</p>
<p class="verse">Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.</p>
<p class="verse">If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:</p>
<p class="verse">For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.</p>
<p class="verse">Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</p>
<p class="verse">For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.</p>
<p class="verse">Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;</p>
<p class="verse">Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:</p>
<p class="verse">Because that for his name’s sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</p>

<p class="verse">Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called:</p>
<p class="verse">Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.</p>
<p class="verse">Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.</p>
<p class="verse">For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.</p>
<p class="verse">And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.</p>
<p class="verse">Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.</p>
<p class="verse">But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.</p>
<p class="verse">Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.</p>
<p class="verse">These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;</p>
<p class="verse">Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,</p>
<p class="verse">To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.</p>
<p class="verse">These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men’s persons in admiration because of advantage.</p>
<p class="verse">But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;</p>
<p class="verse">How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.</p>
<p class="verse">These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse">But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,</p>
<p class="verse">Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse">And of some have compassion, making a difference:</p>
<p class="verse">And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.</p>
<p class="verse">Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,</p>
<p class="verse">To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.</p>
