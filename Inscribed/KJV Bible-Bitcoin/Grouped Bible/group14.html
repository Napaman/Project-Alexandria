<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd, and of the flock.</p>
<p class="verse">If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.</p>
<p class="verse">And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire:</p>
<p class="verse">And the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:</p>
<p class="verse">But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:</p>
<p class="verse">But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes:</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-leviticus-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon:</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD:</p>
<p class="verse">And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’: it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.</p>
<p class="verse">And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.</p>
<p class="verse">And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meat offering.</p>
<p class="verse">And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, he shall bring it unto the altar.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’: it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.</p>
<p class="verse">No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the LORD made by fire.</p>
<p class="verse">As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.</p>
<p class="verse">And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.</p>
<p class="verse">And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is a meat offering.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-leviticus-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron’s sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,</p>
<p class="verse">And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.</p>
<p class="verse">And Aaron’s sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the LORD be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish.</p>
<p class="verse">If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron’s sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, and the whole rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,</p>
<p class="verse">And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,</p>
<p class="verse">And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat is the LORD’s.</p>
<p class="verse">It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-leviticus-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them:</p>
<p class="verse">If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock’s head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock’s blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,</p>
<p class="verse">And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away,</p>
<p class="verse">As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering.</p>
<p class="verse">And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,</p>
<p class="verse">Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.</p>
<p class="verse">And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty;</p>
<p class="verse">When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse">And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock’s blood to the tabernacle of the congregation:</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the vail.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the altar.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn him as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse">When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things which should not be done, and is guilty;</p>
<p class="verse">Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish:</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it is a sin offering.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.</p>
<p class="verse">And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and be guilty;</p>
<p class="verse">Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.</p>
<p class="verse">And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar:</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a witness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse">Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase of an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty.</p>
<p class="verse">Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness it be that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.</p>
<p class="verse">Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing:</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats, for a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin.</p>
<p class="verse">And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head from his neck, but shall not divide it asunder:</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is a sin offering.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to the manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.</p>
<p class="verse">But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a sin offering.</p>
<p class="verse">Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: it is a sin offering.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him: and the remnant shall be the priest’s, as a meat offering.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering:</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.</p>
<p class="verse">And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he wist it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be forgiven him.</p>
<p class="verse">It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed against the LORD.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-leviticus-6">
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour;</p>
<p class="verse">Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein:</p>
<p class="verse">Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found,</p>
<p class="verse">Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day of his trespass offering.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest:</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in trespassing therein.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.</p>
<p class="verse">And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings.</p>
<p class="verse">The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out.</p>
<p class="verse">And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour, even the memorial of it, unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.</p>
<p class="verse">It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them for their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the sin offering, and as the trespass offering.</p>
<p class="verse">All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth them shall be holy.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at night.</p>
<p class="verse">In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou shalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be wholly burnt.</p>
<p class="verse">For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD: it is most holy.</p>
<p class="verse">The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse">Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place.</p>
<p class="verse">But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed in water.</p>
<p class="verse">All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most holy.</p>
<p class="verse">And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-leviticus-7">
<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="verse">Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most holy.</p>
<p class="verse">In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards,</p>
<p class="verse">And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away:</p>

<p class="verse">As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have it.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest that offereth any man’s burnt offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest’s that offereth it.</p>
<p class="verse">And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.</p>
<p class="verse">And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he shall offer unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.</p>
<p class="verse">Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.</p>
<p class="verse">And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest’s that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.</p>
<p class="verse">And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.</p>
<p class="verse">But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:</p>
<p class="verse">But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.</p>
<p class="verse">And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse">And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.</p>
<p class="verse">And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye shall in no wise eat of it.</p>
<p class="verse">For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.</p>
<p class="verse">Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation unto the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace offerings.</p>
<p class="verse">His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall be Aaron’s and his sons’.</p>
<p class="verse">And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.</p>
<p class="verse">He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part.</p>
<p class="verse">For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest’s office;</p>
<p class="verse">Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for ever throughout their generations.</p>
<p class="verse">This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings;</p>
<p class="verse">Which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;</p>
<p class="verse">And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the LORD commanded to be done.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.</p>
<p class="verse">And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith.</p>
<p class="verse">And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.</p>
<p class="verse">And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them.</p>
<p class="verse">And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.</p>
<p class="verse">And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse">And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering.</p>
<p class="verse">And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned it upon the altar.</p>
<p class="verse">But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse">And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.</p>
<p class="verse">And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.</p>
<p class="verse">And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.</p>
<p class="verse">And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savour, and an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse">And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.</p>
<p class="verse">And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it upon the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.</p>
<p class="verse">And he brought Aaron’s sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:</p>
<p class="verse">And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and upon the right shoulder:</p>
<p class="verse">And he put all upon Aaron’s hands, and upon his sons’ hands, and waved them for a wave offering before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses’ part; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons’ garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons’ garments with him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.</p>
<p class="verse">And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.</p>
<p class="verse">As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to make an atonement for you.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.</p>
<p class="verse">So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;</p>
<p class="verse">Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.</p>
<p class="verse">Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.</p>
<p class="verse">And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:</p>
<p class="verse">But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse">And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.</p>
<p class="verse">And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.</p>
<p class="verse">And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.</p>
<p class="verse">And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar.</p>
<p class="verse">And he brought the people’s offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.</p>
<p class="verse">And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner.</p>
<p class="verse">And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.</p>
<p class="verse">He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron’s sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,</p>
<p class="verse">And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:</p>
<p class="verse">And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:</p>
<p class="verse">And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.</p>
<p class="verse">And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.</p>
<p class="verse">And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.</p>

<p class="verse">And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.</p>
<p class="verse">And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.</p>
<p class="verse">So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:</p>
<p class="verse">And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;</p>
<p class="verse">And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy:</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons’ due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.</p>
<p class="verse">And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be thy due, and thy sons’ due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons’ with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.</p>
<p class="verse">And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?</p>
<p class="verse">And when Moses heard that, he was content.</p>

<p class="verse">Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.</p>
<p class="verse">Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you.</p>
<p class="verse">These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.</p>
<p class="verse">And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you:</p>

<p class="verse">Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you.</p>

<p class="verse">Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.</p>
<p class="verse">But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet, shall be an abomination unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even.</p>

<p class="verse">These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.</p>

<p class="verse">He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.</p>
<p class="verse">And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;</p>
<p class="verse">Then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it is fret inward, whether it be bare within or without.</p>
<p class="verse">And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:</p>
<p class="verse">And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire.</p>
<p class="verse">And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.</p>
<p class="verse">This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.</p>

<p class="verse">Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water:</p>
<p class="verse">As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water:</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field.</p>
<p class="verse">And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.</p>
<p class="verse">But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.</p>
<p class="verse">And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.</p>

<p class="verse">And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house;</p>
<p class="verse">Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city:</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place:</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall plaister the house.</p>
<p class="verse">And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plaistered;</p>
<p class="verse">Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even.</p>
<p class="verse">And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.</p>
<p class="verse">And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:</p>
<p class="verse">But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean.</p>
<p class="verse">This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall,</p>

<p class="verse">Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.</p>
<p class="verse">He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.</p>

<p class="verse">And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people.</p>
<p class="verse">For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.</p>
<p class="verse">And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.</p>
<p class="verse">For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.</p>
<p class="verse">And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.</p>
<p class="verse">But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear his iniquity.</p>

<h3>Chapter 18</h3>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse">After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.</p>
<p class="verse">The nakedness of thy father’s wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy father’s nakedness.</p>
<p class="verse">The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.</p>
<p class="verse">The nakedness of thy son’s daughter, or of thy daughter’s daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is thine own nakedness.</p>
<p class="verse">The nakedness of thy father’s wife’s daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s sister: she is thy father’s near kinswoman.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister: for she is thy mother’s near kinswoman.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law: she is thy son’s wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother’s wife: it is thy brother’s nakedness.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shalt thou take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are her near kinswomen: it is wickedness.</p>
<p class="verse">Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.</p>
<p class="verse">Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour’s wife, to defile thyself with her.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.</p>
<p class="verse">Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it is confusion.</p>
<p class="verse">Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:</p>
<p class="verse">And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you:</p>
<p class="verse">(For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled;)</p>
<p class="verse">That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that were before you.</p>
<p class="verse">For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD your God.</p>

<p class="verse">Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse">Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse">And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye shall offer it at your own will.</p>
<p class="verse">It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire.</p>
<p class="verse">And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it shall not be accepted.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</p>
<p class="verse">And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest.</p>

<p class="verse">Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour: I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass offering.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.</p>
<p class="verse">But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD withal.</p>
<p class="verse">And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him.</p>
<p class="verse">But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure.</p>
<p class="verse">Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt.</p>

<p class="verse">And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.</p>
<p class="verse">And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:</p>

<p class="verse">And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.</p>
<p class="verse">Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD which sanctify you.</p>

<p class="verse">And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them.</p>
<p class="verse">If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.</p>
<p class="verse">And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.</p>
<p class="verse">And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast.</p>
<p class="verse">And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.</p>
<p class="verse">And if a man shall take his sister, his father’s daughter, or his mother’s daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister’s nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse">And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.</p>

<p class="verse">It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.</p>
<p class="verse">Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a solemn assembly; and ye shall do no servile work therein.</p>
<p class="verse">These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing upon his day:</p>
<p class="verse">Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths:</p>
<p class="verse">That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD.</p>

<h3>Chapter 24</h3>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.</p>
<p class="verse">Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the LORD continually: it shall be a statute for ever in your generations.</p>
<p class="verse">He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the LORD continually.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall be Aaron’s and his sons’; and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.</p>
<p class="verse">And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;</p>
<p class="verse">And the Israelitish woman’s son blasphemed the name of the Lord, and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)</p>
<p class="verse">And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.</p>
<p class="verse">And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse">And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse">And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.</p>
<p class="verse">And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him;</p>
<p class="verse">Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again.</p>
<p class="verse">And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>

<h3>Chapter 25</h3>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;</p>
<p class="verse">But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.</p>
<p class="verse">That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a year of rest unto the land.</p>
<p class="verse">And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee,</p>
<p class="verse">And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.</p>
<p class="verse">Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.</p>
<p class="verse">A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed.</p>
<p class="verse">For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.</p>
<p class="verse">In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession.</p>
<p class="verse">And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy neighbour’s hand, ye shall not oppress one another:</p>
<p class="verse">According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:</p>
<p class="verse">According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God:for I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.</p>
<p class="verse">And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.</p>
<p class="verse">And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:</p>
<p class="verse">Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store.</p>
<p class="verse">The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.</p>
<p class="verse">And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.</p>
<p class="verse">If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.</p>
<p class="verse">And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;</p>
<p class="verse">Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession.</p>
<p class="verse">But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.</p>
<p class="verse">And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it.</p>
<p class="verse">And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile.</p>
<p class="verse">But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.</p>
<p class="verse">Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.</p>
<p class="verse">And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.</p>
<p class="verse">And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.</p>
<p class="verse">I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.</p>
<p class="verse">And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:</p>
<p class="verse">But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile:</p>
<p class="verse">And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.</p>
<p class="verse">For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God.</p>
<p class="verse">Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.</p>
<p class="verse">And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger’s family:</p>
<p class="verse">After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:</p>
<p class="verse">Either his uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.</p>
<p class="verse">If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.</p>
<p class="verse">And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.</p>
<p class="verse">And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.</p>
<p class="verse">And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.</p>
<p class="verse">For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.</p>

<h3>Chapter 26</h3>
<p class="verse">Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;</p>
<p class="verse">Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.</p>
<p class="verse">And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.</p>
<p class="verse">And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.</p>
<p class="verse">For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.</p>
<p class="verse">I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.</p>
<p class="verse">But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;</p>
<p class="verse">And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant:</p>
<p class="verse">I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.</p>
<p class="verse">And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:</p>
<p class="verse">And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.</p>
<p class="verse">And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.</p>
<p class="verse">I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate.</p>
<p class="verse">And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me;</p>
<p class="verse">Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.</p>
<p class="verse">And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.</p>
<p class="verse">And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;</p>
<p class="verse">Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.</p>
<p class="verse">Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies’ land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.</p>
<p class="verse">As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.</p>
<p class="verse">And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.</p>
<p class="verse">And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.</p>
<p class="verse">If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;</p>
<p class="verse">And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:</p>
<p class="verse">Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.</p>
<p class="verse">The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.</p>
<p class="verse">And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God.</p>
<p class="verse">But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-leviticus-27">
<h3>Chapter 27</h3>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by thy estimation.</p>
<p class="verse">And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.</p>
<p class="verse">And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.</p>
<p class="verse">And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</p>
<p class="verse">And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.</p>
<p class="verse">And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</p>
<p class="verse">But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.</p>
<p class="verse">And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.</p>
<p class="verse">He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.</p>
<p class="verse">And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest:</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.</p>
<p class="verse">But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy estimation.</p>
<p class="verse">And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.</p>
<p class="verse">And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.</p>
<p class="verse">And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.</p>
<p class="verse">If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand.</p>
<p class="verse">But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.</p>
<p class="verse">And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.</p>
<p class="verse">And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.</p>
<p class="verse">But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest’s.</p>
<p class="verse">And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;</p>
<p class="verse">Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong.</p>
<p class="verse">And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.</p>
<p class="verse">Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD’s firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the LORD’s.</p>
<p class="verse">And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.</p>
<p class="verse">Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD’s: it is holy unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.</p>
<p class="verse">These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.</p>

<p class="verse">Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.</p>
<p class="verse">So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.</p>
<p class="verse">And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.</p>
<p class="verse">And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare him after Absalom.</p>
<p class="verse">And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.</p>
<p class="verse">But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.</p>
<p class="verse">And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah the king’s servants:</p>
<p class="verse">But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.</p>
<p class="verse">Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.</p>
<p class="verse">And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.</p>
<p class="verse">And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?</p>
<p class="verse">And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.</p>
<p class="verse">And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not:</p>
<p class="verse">And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</p>
<p class="verse">Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.</p>
<p class="verse">And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.</p>
<p class="verse">And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.</p>
<p class="verse">And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?</p>
<p class="verse">For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king’s sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.</p>
<p class="verse">But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.</p>
<p class="verse">Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</p>
<p class="verse">Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,</p>
<p class="verse">Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.</p>
<p class="verse">The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:</p>
<p class="verse">And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.</p>
<p class="verse">Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.</p>
<p class="verse">As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.</p>
<p class="verse">So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon.</p>
<p class="verse">And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.</p>
<p class="verse">And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?</p>
<p class="verse">And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule:</p>
<p class="verse">And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.</p>
<p class="verse">And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse">And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.</p>
<p class="verse">And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.</p>
<p class="verse">And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.</p>
<p class="verse">So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 kings-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;</p>
<p class="verse">And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:</p>
<p class="verse">That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.</p>
<p class="verse">Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.</p>
<p class="verse">But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood.</p>
<p class="verse">So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.</p>
<p class="verse">And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.</p>
<p class="verse">And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.</p>
<p class="verse">He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother’s: for it was his from the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.</p>
<p class="verse">And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.</p>
<p class="verse">Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand.</p>
<p class="verse">Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.</p>
<p class="verse">And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.</p>
<p class="verse">And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.</p>
<p class="verse">Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.</p>
<p class="verse">And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.</p>
<p class="verse">And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the LORD God before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.</p>
<p class="verse">So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</p>
<p class="verse">Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.</p>
<p class="verse">For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.</p>
<p class="verse">And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath.</p>
<p class="verse">And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good.</p>
<p class="verse">Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?</p>
<p class="verse">The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;</p>
<p class="verse">And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 kings-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh’s daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.</p>
<p class="verse">Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.</p>
<p class="verse">In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.</p>
<p class="verse">And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.</p>
<p class="verse">And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.</p>
<p class="verse">Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?</p>
<p class="verse">And the speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing.</p>
<p class="verse">And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days.</p>
<p class="verse">And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.</p>
<p class="verse">Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him.</p>
<p class="verse">And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.</p>
<p class="verse">And this woman’s child died in the night; because she overlaid it.</p>
<p class="verse">And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.</p>
<p class="verse">And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.</p>
<p class="verse">And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the king.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.</p>
<p class="verse">Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">So king Solomon was king over all Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest,</p>
<p class="verse">Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder.</p>
<p class="verse">And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:</p>
<p class="verse">And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king’s friend:</p>
<p class="verse">And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision.</p>
<p class="verse">And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:</p>
<p class="verse">The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh, and Elonbethhanan:</p>
<p class="verse">The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher:</p>
<p class="verse">The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:</p>
<p class="verse">Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Bethshean to Abelmeholah, even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam:</p>
<p class="verse">The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars:</p>
<p class="verse">Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim:</p>
<p class="verse">Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife:</p>
<p class="verse">Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth:</p>
<p class="verse">Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar:</p>
<p class="verse">Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:</p>
<p class="verse">Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land.</p>
<p class="verse">Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,</p>
<p class="verse">Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl.</p>
<p class="verse">For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.</p>
<p class="verse">And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon’s table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing.</p>
<p class="verse">Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge.</p>
<p class="verse">And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse">For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about.</p>
<p class="verse">And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.</p>
<p class="verse">And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.</p>
<p class="verse">And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 kings-5">
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.</p>
<p class="verse">But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.</p>
<p class="verse">And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.</p>
<p class="verse">My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.</p>
<p class="verse">So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.</p>
<p class="verse">And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.</p>
<p class="verse">And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was over the levy.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;</p>
<p class="verse">Beside the chief of Solomon’s officers which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders did hew them, and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 kings-6">
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.</p>
<p class="verse">And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.</p>
<p class="verse">And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.</p>
<p class="verse">And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:</p>
<p class="verse">The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.</p>
<p class="verse">And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.</p>
<p class="verse">The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.</p>
<p class="verse">So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.</p>
<p class="verse">And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.</p>
<p class="verse">And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father:</p>
<p class="verse">And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">So Solomon built the house, and finished it.</p>
<p class="verse">And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.</p>
<p class="verse">And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.</p>
<p class="verse">And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.</p>
<p class="verse">And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.</p>
<p class="verse">And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar.</p>
<p class="verse">So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.</p>
<p class="verse">And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.</p>
<p class="verse">And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits high.</p>
<p class="verse">And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.</p>
<p class="verse">And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one measure and one size.</p>
<p class="verse">The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.</p>
<p class="verse">And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.</p>
<p class="verse">And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.</p>
<p class="verse">And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.</p>
<p class="verse">And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.</p>
<p class="verse">And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.</p>
<p class="verse">The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.</p>
<p class="verse">So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall.</p>
<p class="verse">And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.</p>
<p class="verse">And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.</p>
<p class="verse">And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.</p>
<p class="verse">In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:</p>
<p class="verse">And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 kings-7">
<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="verse">But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.</p>
<p class="verse">He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row.</p>
<p class="verse">And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in three ranks.</p>
<p class="verse">And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them.</p>
<p class="verse">Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.</p>
<p class="verse">And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.</p>
<p class="verse">All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.</p>
<p class="verse">And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.</p>
<p class="verse">And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars.</p>
<p class="verse">And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.</p>
<p class="verse">And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.</p>
<p class="verse">He was a widow’s son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.</p>
<p class="verse">For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.</p>
<p class="verse">And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:</p>
<p class="verse">And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.</p>
<p class="verse">And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.</p>
<p class="verse">And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits.</p>
<p class="verse">And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.</p>
<p class="verse">And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.</p>
<p class="verse">And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.</p>
<p class="verse">And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.</p>
<p class="verse">And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.</p>
<p class="verse">It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.</p>
<p class="verse">And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.</p>
<p class="verse">And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:</p>
<p class="verse">And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.</p>
<p class="verse">And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.</p>
<p class="verse">And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.</p>
<p class="verse">And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.</p>
<p class="verse">And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were all molten.</p>
<p class="verse">And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself.</p>
<p class="verse">And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same.</p>
<p class="verse">For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.</p>
<p class="verse">After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size.</p>
<p class="verse">Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver.</p>
<p class="verse">And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.</p>
<p class="verse">And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD:</p>
<p class="verse">The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars;</p>
<p class="verse">And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars;</p>
<p class="verse">And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;</p>
<p class="verse">And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;</p>
<p class="verse">And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of bright brass.</p>
<p class="verse">In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread was,</p>
<p class="verse">And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,</p>
<p class="verse">And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.</p>
<p class="verse">So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 kings-8">
<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="verse">Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.</p>
<p class="verse">And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.</p>
<p class="verse">And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims.</p>
<p class="verse">For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.</p>
<p class="verse">And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse">There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,</p>
<p class="verse">So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.</p>
<p class="verse">I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven:</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart:</p>
<p class="verse">Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me.</p>
<p class="verse">And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.</p>
<p class="verse">But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?</p>
<p class="verse">Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:</p>
<p class="verse">That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place.</p>
<p class="verse">And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive.</p>
<p class="verse">If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house:</p>
<p class="verse">Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse">When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house:</p>
<p class="verse">Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them:</p>
<p class="verse">Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse">If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be;</p>
<p class="verse">What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:</p>
<p class="verse">Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)</p>
<p class="verse">That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name’s sake;</p>
<p class="verse">(For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house;</p>
<p class="verse">Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy name.</p>
<p class="verse">If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I have built for thy name:</p>
<p class="verse">Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.</p>
<p class="verse">If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;</p>
<p class="verse">Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;</p>
<p class="verse">And so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name:</p>
<p class="verse">Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause,</p>
<p class="verse">And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:</p>
<p class="verse">For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron:</p>
<p class="verse">That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse">For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O LORD God.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:</p>
<p class="verse">That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:</p>
<p class="verse">That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else.</p>
<p class="verse">Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brasen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.</p>
<p class="verse">And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.</p>
<p class="verse">On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 kings-9">
<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the LORD, and the king’s house, and all Solomon’s desire which he was pleased to do,</p>
<p class="verse">That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.</p>
<p class="verse">And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:</p>
<p class="verse">Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:</p>
<p class="verse">Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:</p>
<p class="verse">And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king’s house,</p>
<p class="verse">(Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse">And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse">And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.</p>
<p class="verse">And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.</p>
<p class="verse">For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon’s wife.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether,</p>
<p class="verse">And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,</p>
<p class="verse">And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel,</p>
<p class="verse">Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse">But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.</p>
<p class="verse">These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon’s work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work.</p>
<p class="verse">But Pharaoh’s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.</p>
<p class="verse">And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the house.</p>
<p class="verse">And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.</p>
<p class="verse">And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.</p>
<p class="verse">And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 kings-10">
<h3>Chapter 10</h3>
<p class="verse">And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions.</p>
<p class="verse">And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing hid from the king, which he told her not.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon’s wisdom, and the house that he had built,</p>
<p class="verse">And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.</p>
<p class="verse">And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.</p>
<p class="verse">Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice.</p>
<p class="verse">And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.</p>
<p class="verse">And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king’s house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse">And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,</p>
<p class="verse">Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.</p>
<p class="verse">And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target.</p>
<p class="verse">And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.</p>
<p class="verse">The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.</p>
<p class="verse">And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse">And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.</p>
<p class="verse">For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</p>
<p class="verse">So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.</p>
<p class="verse">And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</p>
<p class="verse">And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 kings-11">
<h3>Chapter 11</h3>
<p class="verse">But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites;</p>
<p class="verse">Of the nations concerning which the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.</p>
<p class="verse">And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.</p>
<p class="verse">For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.</p>
<p class="verse">For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as did David his father.</p>
<p class="verse">Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.</p>
<p class="verse">And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice,</p>
<p class="verse">And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.</p>
<p class="verse">Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father’s sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake which I have chosen.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king’s seed in Edom.</p>
<p class="verse">For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;</p>
<p class="verse">(For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:)</p>
<p class="verse">That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child.</p>
<p class="verse">And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.</p>
<p class="verse">And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.</p>
<p class="verse">And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s household among the sons of Pharaoh.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.</p>
<p class="verse">And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:</p>
<p class="verse">And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.</p>
<p class="verse">And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon’s servant, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king.</p>
<p class="verse">And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.</p>
<p class="verse">And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field:</p>
<p class="verse">And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces:</p>
<p class="verse">And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:</p>
<p class="verse">(But he shall have one tribe for my servant David’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)</p>
<p class="verse">Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his father.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant’s sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:</p>
<p class="verse">But I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes.</p>
<p class="verse">And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.</p>
<p class="verse">And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?</p>
<p class="verse">And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 kings-12">
<h3>Chapter 12</h3>
<p class="verse">And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)</p>
<p class="verse">That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.</p>
<p class="verse">And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?</p>
<p class="verse">And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which stood before him:</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?</p>
<p class="verse">And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father’s loins.</p>
<p class="verse">And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</p>
<p class="verse">So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men’s counsel that they gave him;</p>
<p class="verse">And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</p>
<p class="verse">So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents.</p>
<p class="verse">But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</p>
<p class="verse">Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.</p>
<p class="verse">But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:</p>
<p class="verse">If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse">And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.</p>
<p class="verse">And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan.</p>
<p class="verse">And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.</p>
<p class="verse">So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 kings-13">
<h3>Chapter 13</h3>
<p class="verse">And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.</p>
<p class="verse">And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men’s bones shall be burnt upon thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him.</p>
<p class="verse">The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king’s hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.</p>
<p class="verse">And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place:</p>
<p class="verse">For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest.</p>
<p class="verse">So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel.</p>
<p class="verse">Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father.</p>
<p class="verse">And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon,</p>
<p class="verse">And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am.</p>
<p class="verse">Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:</p>
<p class="verse">For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest.</p>
<p class="verse">He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him.</p>
<p class="verse">So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back:</p>
<p class="verse">And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee,</p>
<p class="verse">But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which the Lord did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcase.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake unto him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the carcase, nor torn the ass.</p>
<p class="verse">And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones:</p>
<p class="verse">For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.</p>
<p class="verse">After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places.</p>
<p class="verse">And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 kings-14">
<h3>Chapter 14</h3>
<p class="verse">At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which told me that I should be king over this people.</p>
<p class="verse">And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the child.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she shall feign herself to be another woman.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.</p>
<p class="verse">Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel,</p>
<p class="verse">And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes;</p>
<p class="verse">But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it be all gone.</p>
<p class="verse">Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD hath spoken it.</p>
<p class="verse">Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.</p>
<p class="verse">And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.</p>
<p class="verse">For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who made Israel to sin.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jeroboam’s wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died;</p>
<p class="verse">And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet.</p>
<p class="verse">And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse">And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother’s name was Naamah an Ammonitess.</p>
<p class="verse">And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done.</p>
<p class="verse">For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.</p>
<p class="verse">And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:</p>
<p class="verse">And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</p>
<p class="verse">And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of the king’s house.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD, that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard chamber.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>
<p class="verse">And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.</p>
<p class="verse">And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother’s name was Naamah an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 kings-15">
<h3>Chapter 15</h3>
<p class="verse">Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.</p>
<p class="verse">And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless for David’s sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:</p>
<p class="verse">Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.</p>
<p class="verse">And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.</p>
<p class="verse">And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse">And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.</p>
<p class="verse">And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did David his father.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.</p>
<p class="verse">And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.</p>
<p class="verse">But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa’s heart was perfect with the LORD all his days.</p>
<p class="verse">And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels.</p>
<p class="verse">And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.</p>
<p class="verse">And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">There is a league between me and thee, and between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.</p>
<p class="verse">So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.</p>
<p class="verse">Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.</p>
<p class="verse">The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.</p>
<p class="verse">And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse">And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.</p>
<p class="verse">And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.</p>
<p class="verse">And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon.</p>
<p class="verse">Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:</p>
<p class="verse">Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>
<p class="verse">And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.</p>
<p class="verse">In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years.</p>
<p class="verse">And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 kings-16">
<h3>Chapter 16</h3>
<p class="verse">Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</p>
<p class="verse">Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>
<p class="verse">So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse">And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.</p>
<p class="verse">In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.</p>
<p class="verse">And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.</p>
<p class="verse">And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,</p>
<p class="verse">For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>
<p class="verse">In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.</p>
<p class="verse">And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.</p>
<p class="verse">And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king’s house, and burnt the king’s house over him with fire, and died,</p>
<p class="verse">For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>
<p class="verse">Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.</p>
<p class="verse">But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.</p>
<p class="verse">In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.</p>
<p class="verse">And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.</p>
<p class="verse">But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that were before him.</p>
<p class="verse">For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he shewed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>
<p class="verse">So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse">And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.</p>
<p class="verse">And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that were before him.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.</p>
<p class="verse">And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.</p>
<p class="verse">In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 kings-17">
<h3>Chapter 17</h3>
<p class="verse">And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.</p>
<p class="verse">And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.</p>
<p class="verse">So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse">And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.</p>
<p class="verse">And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.</p>
<p class="verse">So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.</p>
<p class="verse">And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.</p>
<p class="verse">For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.</p>
<p class="verse">And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.</p>
<p class="verse">And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.</p>
<p class="verse">And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?</p>
<p class="verse">And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child’s soul come into him again.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.</p>
<p class="verse">And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 kings-18">
<h3>Chapter 18</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore famine in Samaria.</p>
<p class="verse">And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:</p>
<p class="verse">For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)</p>
<p class="verse">And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.</p>
<p class="verse">So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.</p>
<p class="verse">And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?</p>
<p class="verse">And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?</p>
<p class="verse">As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.</p>
<p class="verse">And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.</p>
<p class="verse">Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD’s prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?</p>
<p class="verse">And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he shall slay me.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.</p>
<p class="verse">So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?</p>
<p class="verse">And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel’s table.</p>
<p class="verse">So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal’s prophets are four hundred and fifty men.</p>
<p class="verse">Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:</p>
<p class="verse">And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.</p>
<p class="verse">And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.</p>
<p class="verse">And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:</p>
<p class="verse">And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.</p>
<p class="verse">And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.</p>
<p class="verse">And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.</p>
<p class="verse">Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.</p>
<p class="verse">And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.</p>
<p class="verse">So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,</p>
<p class="verse">And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man’s hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.</p>
<p class="verse">And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 kings-19">
<h3>Chapter 19</h3>
<p class="verse">And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.</p>
<p class="verse">But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.</p>
<p class="verse">And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.</p>
<p class="verse">And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake:</p>
<p class="verse">And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria:</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.</p>
<p class="verse">So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?</p>
<p class="verse">And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.</p>

<h3>Chapter 20</h3>
<p class="verse">And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.</p>
<p class="verse">And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Benhadad,</p>
<p class="verse">Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.</p>
<p class="verse">And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Benhadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;</p>
<p class="verse">Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not unto him, nor consent.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.</p>
<p class="verse">And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array against the city.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Even by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, Thou.</p>
<p class="verse">Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.</p>
<p class="verse">And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.</p>
<p class="verse">And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.</p>
<p class="verse">So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them.</p>
<p class="verse">And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.</p>
<p class="verse">And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.</p>
<p class="verse">And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms:</p>
<p class="verse">And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.</p>
<p class="verse">And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD is God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day.</p>
<p class="verse">But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left. And Benhadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.</p>
<p class="verse">And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life.</p>
<p class="verse">So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Benhadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy brother Benhadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.</p>
<p class="verse">And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.</p>
<p class="verse">And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.</p>
<p class="verse">So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.</p>
<p class="verse">And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.</p>
<p class="verse">And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.</p>
<p class="verse">And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 kings-21">
<h3>Chapter 21</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.</p>
<p class="verse">And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.</p>
<p class="verse">And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.</p>
<p class="verse">So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.</p>
<p class="verse">And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:</p>
<p class="verse">And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.</p>
<p class="verse">And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.</p>
<p class="verse">And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.</p>
<p class="verse">Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.</p>
<p class="verse">And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to possess it.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.</p>
<p class="verse">And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,</p>
<p class="verse">And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.</p>
<p class="verse">And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.</p>
<p class="verse">Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.</p>
<p class="verse">But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.</p>
<p class="verse">And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.</p>
<p class="verse">And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son’s days will I bring the evil upon his house.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 kings-22">
<h3>Chapter 22</h3>
<p class="verse">And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten hither Micaiah the son of Imlah.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.</p>
<p class="verse">And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the king’s hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.</p>
<p class="verse">And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto me, that will I speak.</p>
<p class="verse">So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD?</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.</p>
<p class="verse">And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.</p>
<p class="verse">But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?</p>
<p class="verse">And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;</p>
<p class="verse">And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.</p>
<p class="verse">And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.</p>
<p class="verse">So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.</p>
<p class="verse">But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.</p>
<p class="verse">And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.</p>
<p class="verse">And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.</p>
<p class="verse">And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.</p>
<p class="verse">So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.</p>
<p class="verse">And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the LORD which he spake.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>
<p class="verse">So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.</p>
<p class="verse">And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>
<p class="verse">And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land.</p>
<p class="verse">There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.</p>
<p class="verse">Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse">Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:</p>
<p class="verse">For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</p>
<p class="verse">My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;</p>
<p class="verse">Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</p>
<p class="verse">But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</p>
<p class="verse">If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</p>
<p class="verse">But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</p>
<p class="verse">For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.</p>
<p class="verse">Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:</p>
<p class="verse">But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</p>
<p class="verse">For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</p>
<p class="verse">Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:</p>
<p class="verse">But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.</p>
<p class="verse">Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</p>
<p class="verse">Do not err, my beloved brethren.</p>
<p class="verse">Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</p>
<p class="verse">Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</p>
<p class="verse">For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</p>
<p class="verse">But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</p>
<p class="verse">For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</p>
<p class="verse">For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</p>
<p class="verse">But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</p>
<p class="verse">If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.</p>
<p class="verse">Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-james-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.</p>
<p class="verse">For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;</p>
<p class="verse">And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:</p>
<p class="verse">Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</p>
<p class="verse">Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?</p>
<p class="verse">But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?</p>
<p class="verse">Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?</p>
<p class="verse">If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:</p>
<p class="verse">But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.</p>
<p class="verse">For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</p>
<p class="verse">For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</p>
<p class="verse">So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</p>
<p class="verse">For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.</p>
<p class="verse">What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?</p>
<p class="verse">If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,</p>
<p class="verse">And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?</p>
<p class="verse">Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</p>
<p class="verse">But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</p>
<p class="verse">Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</p>
<p class="verse">Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?</p>
<p class="verse">And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?</p>
<p class="verse">For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.</p>
<p class="verse">For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.</p>
<p class="verse">Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!</p>
<p class="verse">And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.</p>
<p class="verse">For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:</p>
<p class="verse">But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.</p>
<p class="verse">Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</p>
<p class="verse">Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?</p>
<p class="verse">Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.</p>
<p class="verse">Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse">But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.</p>
<p class="verse">For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.</p>
<p class="verse">But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.</p>
<p class="verse">And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?</p>
<p class="verse">Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?</p>
<p class="verse">But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.</p>
<p class="verse">Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</p>
<p class="verse">Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.</p>
<p class="verse">Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.</p>
<p class="verse">Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.</p>
<p class="verse">Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.</p>
<p class="verse">There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?</p>
<p class="verse">Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:</p>
<p class="verse">Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.</p>
<p class="verse">For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.</p>
<p class="verse">But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you.</p>
<p class="verse">Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.</p>
<p class="verse">Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.</p>
<p class="verse">Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.</p>
<p class="verse">Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.</p>
<p class="verse">Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.</p>
<p class="verse">Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.</p>
<p class="verse">But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.</p>
<p class="verse">Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.</p>
<p class="verse">Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:</p>
<p class="verse">And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.</p>
<p class="verse">Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</p>
<p class="verse">Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.</p>
<p class="verse">And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.</p>
<p class="verse">Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;</p>
<p class="verse">Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,</p>
<p class="verse">Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</p>
<p class="verse">To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,</p>
<p class="verse">Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:</p>
<p class="verse">That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse">Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:</p>
<p class="verse">Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.</p>
<p class="verse">Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:</p>
<p class="verse">Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.</p>
<p class="verse">Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;</p>
<p class="verse">As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:</p>
<p class="verse">But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;</p>
<p class="verse">Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.</p>
<p class="verse">And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man’s work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:</p>
<p class="verse">Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;</p>
<p class="verse">But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:</p>
<p class="verse">Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,</p>
<p class="verse">Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.</p>
<p class="verse">Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently:</p>
<p class="verse">Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:</p>
<p class="verse">But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 peter-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,</p>
<p class="verse">As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:</p>
<p class="verse">If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.</p>
<p class="verse">To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,</p>
<p class="verse">Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.</p>
<p class="verse">Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,</p>
<p class="verse">And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.</p>
<p class="verse">But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:</p>
<p class="verse">Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</p>
<p class="verse">Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;</p>
<p class="verse">Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.</p>
<p class="verse">Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;</p>
<p class="verse">Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.</p>
<p class="verse">For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:</p>
<p class="verse">As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.</p>
<p class="verse">Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.</p>
<p class="verse">For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.</p>
<p class="verse">For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.</p>
<p class="verse">For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:</p>
<p class="verse">Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:</p>
<p class="verse">Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:</p>
<p class="verse">Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.</p>
<p class="verse">For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 peter-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;</p>
<p class="verse">While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.</p>
<p class="verse">Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;</p>
<p class="verse">But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.</p>
<p class="verse">For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:</p>
<p class="verse">Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.</p>
<p class="verse">Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:</p>
<p class="verse">Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.</p>
<p class="verse">For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:</p>
<p class="verse">Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.</p>
<p class="verse">For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.</p>
<p class="verse">And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?</p>
<p class="verse">But and if ye suffer for righteousness’ sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;</p>
<p class="verse">But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:</p>
<p class="verse">Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.</p>
<p class="verse">For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:</p>
<p class="verse">By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;</p>
<p class="verse">Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.</p>
<p class="verse">The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse">Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 peter-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;</p>
<p class="verse">That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.</p>
<p class="verse">For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:</p>
<p class="verse">Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:</p>
<p class="verse">Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.</p>
<p class="verse">For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.</p>
<p class="verse">But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.</p>
<p class="verse">And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.</p>
<p class="verse">Use hospitality one to another without grudging.</p>
<p class="verse">As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</p>
<p class="verse">If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:</p>
<p class="verse">But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.</p>
<p class="verse">If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.</p>
<p class="verse">But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men’s matters.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.</p>
<p class="verse">For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?</p>
<p class="verse">And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 peter-5">
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:</p>
<p class="verse">Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;</p>
<p class="verse">Neither as being lords over God’s heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</p>
<p class="verse">Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:</p>
<p class="verse">Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.</p>
<p class="verse">Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:</p>
<p class="verse">Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.</p>
<p class="verse">But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.</p>
<p class="verse">To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.</p>
<p class="verse">The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son.</p>
<p class="verse">Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>

<p class="verse">Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</p>
<p class="verse">For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.</p>

<p class="verse">Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.</p>
<p class="verse">Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.</p>
<p class="verse">I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:</p>
<p class="verse">But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called:</p>
<p class="verse">Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.</p>
<p class="verse">Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.</p>
<p class="verse">For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.</p>
<p class="verse">And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.</p>
<p class="verse">Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.</p>
<p class="verse">But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.</p>
<p class="verse">Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.</p>
<p class="verse">These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;</p>
<p class="verse">Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,</p>
<p class="verse">To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.</p>
<p class="verse">These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men’s persons in admiration because of advantage.</p>
<p class="verse">But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;</p>
<p class="verse">How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.</p>
<p class="verse">These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse">But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,</p>
<p class="verse">Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse">And of some have compassion, making a difference:</p>
<p class="verse">And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.</p>
<p class="verse">Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,</p>
<p class="verse">To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,</p>
<p class="verse">And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</p>
<p class="verse">Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</p>
<p class="verse">Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</p>
<p class="verse">That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</p>
<p class="verse">Yet for love’s sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</p>
<p class="verse">Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</p>
<p class="verse">Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</p>
<p class="verse">Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</p>
<p class="verse">But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</p>
<p class="verse">For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</p>
<p class="verse">Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</p>
<p class="verse">If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</p>
<p class="verse">If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;</p>
<p class="verse">I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</p>
<p class="verse">But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</p>
<p class="verse">Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</p>
<p class="verse">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>
