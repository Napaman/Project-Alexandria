<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>(There are eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>(The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God’s: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-deuteronomy-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And the LORD spake unto me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>That the LORD spake unto me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-deuteronomy-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>(Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And I gave Gilead unto Machir.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to heaven,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the children of Anak!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-hebrews-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-hebrews-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-hebrews-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-hebrews-5">
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-hebrews-6">
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And this will we do, if God permit.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-hebrews-7">
<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-hebrews-8">
<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-hebrews-10">
<h3>Chapter 10</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And having an high priest over the house of God;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>He that despised Moses’ law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.</p>

<h3>Chapter 11</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>For by it the elders obtained a good report.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom, departing from the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said unto him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the children of whoredoms.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another man: so will I also be for thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are as they that strive with the priest.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers with shame do love, Give ye.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Do not err, my beloved brethren.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-james-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>The LORD hath been sore displeased with your fathers.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these be.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good words and comfortable words.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And the LORD shewed me four carpenters.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.</p>

Revelations Chapter 20: 1-3 "And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season".
