<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child’s life.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-matthew-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And the same John had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-matthew-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-matthew-5">
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God’s throne:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.</p>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Give us this day our daily bread.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?</p>

<h3>Chapter 11</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings’ houses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And charged them that they should not make him known:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47:</span>Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48:</span>But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?</p>

<h3>Chapter 13</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>For this people’s heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47:</span>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48:</span>Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49:</span>So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50:</span>And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51:</span>Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52:</span>Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53:</span>And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54:</span>And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55:</span>Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56:</span>And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57:</span>And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">58:</span>And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But when Herod’s birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>He said, Bring them hither to me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it to dogs.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus’ feet; and he healed them:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother’s womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.</p>

<h3>Chapter 20</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Then came to him the mother of Zebedee’s children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.</p>

<h3>Chapter 21</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.</p>

<h3>Chapter 22</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>For many are called, but few are chosen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And last of all the woman died also.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>Master, which is the great commandment in the law?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>This is the first and great commandment.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of David.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.</p>

<h3>Chapter 24</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>All these are the beginning of sorrows.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Behold, I have told you before.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47:</span>Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48:</span>But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49:</span>And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50:</span>The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51:</span>And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>

<h3>Chapter 25</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</p>

<h3>Chapter 26</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47:</span>And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48:</span>Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49:</span>And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50:</span>And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51:</span>And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest’s, and smote off his ear.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52:</span>Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53:</span>Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54:</span>But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55:</span>In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56:</span>But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57:</span>And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">58:</span>But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest’s palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">59:</span>Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">60:</span>But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">61:</span>And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">62:</span>And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">63:</span>But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">64:</span>Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">65:</span>Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">66:</span>What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">67:</span>Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">68:</span>Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">69:</span>Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">70:</span>But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">71:</span>And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">72:</span>And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">73:</span>And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">74:</span>Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">75:</span>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</p>

<h3>Chapter 27</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And sitting down they watched him there;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47:</span>Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48:</span>And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49:</span>The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50:</span>Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51:</span>And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52:</span>And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53:</span>And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54:</span>Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55:</span>And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56:</span>Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s children.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57:</span>When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">58:</span>He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">59:</span>And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">60:</span>And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">61:</span>And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">62:</span>Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">63:</span>Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">64:</span>Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">65:</span>Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">66:</span>So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-matthew-28">
<h3>Chapter 28</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And if this come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD’s anointed?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD’s anointed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal’s wife the Carmelite.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul’s host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Ishbosheth Saul’s son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow’s side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in Gibeon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he answered, I am.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David’s servants nineteen men and Asahel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner’s men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David’s wife. These were born to David in Hebron.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father’s concubine?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog’s head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul’s daughter, when thou comest to see my face.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul’s son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father’s house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the people wept again over him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And when Saul’s son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And Saul’s son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, that are hated of David’s soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel’s sake.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.</p>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And when they came to Nachon’s threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his household.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul’s daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed every one to his house.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king’s son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon’s house, and dress him meat.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king’s daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king’s sons.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king’s sons, and there is not one of them left.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king’s sons come: as thy servant said, so it is.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.</p>

<h3>Chapter 14</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was toward Absalom.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father’s house: and the king and his throne be guiltless.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And the king said, Whosoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king’s face.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year’s end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king’s weight.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king’s face.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab’s field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king’s face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.</p>

<h3>Chapter 15</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And the king’s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king’s house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 samuel-17">
<h3>Chapter 17</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not; speak thou.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man’s house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went down.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And the woman took and spread a covering over the well’s mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And when Absalom’s servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man’s son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab’s mother.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles, and parched pulse,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.</p>

<h3>Chapter 18</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king’s son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And ten young men that bare Joab’s armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king’s dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom’s place.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king’s son is dead.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king’s servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!</p>

<h3>Chapter 19</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends.

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return thou, and all thy servants.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king’s household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD’s anointed?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>For all of my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David’s men with him, over Jordan?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king’s cost? or hath he given us any gift?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be thou here present.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord’s servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And there went out after him Joab’s men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. And Joab’s garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab’s hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And one of Joab’s men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.</p>

<h3>Chapter 21</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD did choose. And the king said, I will give them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORD’s oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was intreated for the land.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet: and setteth me upon my high places.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47:</span>The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48:</span>It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49:</span>And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50:</span>Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his guard.</p>

<h3>Chapter 24</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Notwithstanding the king’s word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even to Beersheba.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And David’s heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days’ pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father’s house.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</p>
