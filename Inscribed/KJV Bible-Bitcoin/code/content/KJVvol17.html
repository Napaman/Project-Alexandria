<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.</p>

Revelations Chapter 20: 1-3 "And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season".
