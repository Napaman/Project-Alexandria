<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-exodus-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river’s brink.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river’s side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews’ children.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child’s mother.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-exodus-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-exodus-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man’s mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days’ journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47:</span>All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48:</span>And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49:</span>One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what are we, that ye murmur against us?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>So the people rested on the seventh day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And Jethro, Moses’ father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And when Moses’ father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD’s side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of wreathen work of pure gold.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the ephod inward.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and his sockets,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And the covering of rams’ skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers’ skins, and the vail of the covering,</p>

<h3>Chapter 40</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest’s office.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest’s office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash withal.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become tributary!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O LORD, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified himself.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and consider; for I am become vile.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the LORD hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate and faint all the day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the LORD hath delivered me into their hands, from whom I am not able to rise up.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>The LORD hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the LORD hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a winepress.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort her: the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, that his adversaries should be round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to relieve their souls.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled; mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as death.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it: thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called, and they shall be like unto me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>How hath the LORD covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>The LORD hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought them down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>The LORD was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>The LORD hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>They say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into their mothers’ bosom.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>All that pass by clap their hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that men call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed her up: certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>The LORD hath done that which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Their heart cried unto the LORD, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the LORD: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, and not pitied.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the LORD’s anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was of sapphire:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn there.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-romans-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Who will render to every man according to his deeds:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>For there is no respect of persons with God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-romans-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Their feet are swift to shed blood:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Destruction and misery are in their ways:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And the way of peace have they not known:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>There is no fear of God before their eyes.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah’s womb:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And patience, experience; and experience, hope:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam’s transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>For he that is dead is freed from sin.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>

<h3>Chapter 10</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.</p>

<h3>Chapter 11</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sakes.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.</p>

<p class="private-message">Στην οικογένειά μου και τον Θεό που μας καθοδηγεί. Inspired by a conversation on Degen Saturdays between @AdrianDittmann and @T_Bilderberg. Revelations Chapter 20: 1-3 "And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season".
