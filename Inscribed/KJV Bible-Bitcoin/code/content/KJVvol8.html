<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man’s pleasure.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the king’s manner toward all that knew law and judgment:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king’s face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king’s princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>For he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-esther-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king’s chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king’s house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women’s house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Now when every maid’s turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king’s house.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther’s feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king’s gate.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king’s gate, two of the king’s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai’s name.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-esther-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And all the king’s servants, that were in the king’s gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Then the king’s servants, which were in the king’s gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king’s commandment?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king’s laws: therefore it is not for the king’s profit to suffer them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king’s treasuries.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews’ enemy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Then were the king’s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king’s lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king’s ring.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And the letters were sent by posts into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>The posts went out, being hastened by the king’s commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-esther-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And came even before the king’s gate: for none might enter into the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And in every province, whithersoever the king’s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>So Esther’s maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king’s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which was before the king’s gate.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>All the king’s servants, and the people of the king’s provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And they told to Mordecai Esther’s words.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king’s house, more than all the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father’s house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-esther-5">
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, over against the king’s house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-esther-6">
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king’s house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And the king’s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king’s gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And Mordecai came again to the king’s gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And while they were yet talking with him, came the king’s chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of the kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them;</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for I will work a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though it be told you.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work: for I am with you, saith the LORD of hosts:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the LORD; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty measures, there were but ten: when one came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the LORD’s temple was laid, consider it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not brought forth: from this day will I bless you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD, and will make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languisheth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For while they be folden together as thorns, and while they are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the LORD, a wicked counsellor.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Thus saith the LORD; Though they be quiet, and likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand, shall they cry; but none shall look back.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for there is none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant furniture.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and much pain is in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of the young lions, where the lion, even the old lion, walked, and the lion’s whelp, and none made them afraid?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear: and there is a multitude of slain, and a great number of carcases; and there is none end of their corpses; they stumble upon their corpses:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women: the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire shall devour thy bars.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go into clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and fleeth away.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the LORD, the fire was quenched.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the LORD burnt among them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with thee.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD’s hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the LORD’s people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit upon them!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day’s journey on this side, and as it were a day’s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of the men that went to search the land, lived still.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah.</p>

<h3>Chapter 16</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will shew who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow: and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose, he shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them?</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>For which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the LORD: and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each of you his censer.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>To be a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47:</span>And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48:</span>And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49:</span>Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Even the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And the LORD’s anger was kindled the same time, and he sware, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And the LORD’s anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers’ stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the LORD to war,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And the land be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my lord saith.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be ours.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities of the country round about.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>And Nebo, and Baalmeon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they builded.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havothjair.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he was fled;</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man’s work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>But and if ye suffer for righteousness’ sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 peter-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Use hospitality one to another without grudging.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men’s matters.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Neither as being lords over God’s heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the LORD: and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD’s wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not desired;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon you, before the day of the LORD’s anger come upon you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the LORD’s anger.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be rooted up.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the LORD is against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And the sea coast shall be dwellings and cottages for shepherds, and folds for flocks.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening: for the LORD their God shall visit them, and turn away their captivity.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Therefore as I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, even the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall spoil them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the LORD of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>The LORD will be terrible unto them: for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one from his place, even all the isles of the heathen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like a wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds: for he shall uncover the cedar work.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>The just LORD is in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but they rose early, and corrupted all their doings.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly, who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD.</p>

<p class="private-message">Στην οικογένειά μου και τον Θεό που μας καθοδηγεί. Inspired by a conversation on Degen Saturdays between @AdrianDittmann and @T_Bilderberg. Revelations Chapter 20: 1-3 "And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season".
