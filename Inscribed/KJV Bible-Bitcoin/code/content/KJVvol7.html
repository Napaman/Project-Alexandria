<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been already done.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>The wise man’s eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-ecclesiastes-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the gift of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-ecclesiastes-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-ecclesiastes-5">
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool’s voice is known by multitude of words.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities: but fear thou God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is served by the field.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and there is nothing in his hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>As he came forth of his mother’s womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it is his portion.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-ecclesiastes-6">
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also that he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this hath more rest than the other.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it is man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man the better?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one’s birth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself ?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?</p>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man’s wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>I counsel thee to keep the king’s commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man’s heart discerneth both time and judgment.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto me:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man’s wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much good.</p>

<h3>Chapter 10</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>A wise man’s heart is at his right hand; but a fool’s heart at his left.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all things.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>But Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And all the city was gathered together at the door.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>The sower soweth the word.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word’s sake, immediately they are offended.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue’s house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife: for he had married her.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother’s wife.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>And they did all eat, and were filled.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47:</span>And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48:</span>And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49:</span>But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50:</span>For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51:</span>And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52:</span>For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53:</span>And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54:</span>And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55:</span>And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56:</span>And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it unto the dogs.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And they answered, John the Baptist: but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, the same shall save it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>For he that is not against us is on our part.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47:</span>And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48:</span>Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49:</span>For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel’s,</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47:</span>And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48:</span>And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49:</span>And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50:</span>And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51:</span>And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52:</span>And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be our’s.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>This was the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar’s.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. And they marvelled at him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man’s brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>Which devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>And they laid their hands on him, and took him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47:</span>And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48:</span>And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49:</span>I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50:</span>And they all forsook him, and fled.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51:</span>And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52:</span>And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53:</span>And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54:</span>And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55:</span>And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56:</span>For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57:</span>And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">58:</span>We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">59:</span>But neither so did their witness agree together.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">60:</span>And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">61:</span>But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">62:</span>And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">63:</span>Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">64:</span>Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">65:</span>And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">66:</span>And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">67:</span>And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">68:</span>But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">69:</span>And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">70:</span>And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">71:</span>But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">72:</span>And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.</p>

<h3>Chapter 15</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And they cried out again, Crucify him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>Save thyself, and come down from the cross.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47:</span>And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.</p>

<h3>Chapter 16</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And the asses of Kish Saul’s father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer’s house is.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father’s house?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on), but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.</p>

<h3>Chapter 10</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel’s sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And Saul’s uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no where, we came to Samuel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And Saul’s uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us.

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his peace.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.</p>

<h3>Chapter 14</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines’ garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his father.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD’s priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines’ garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man’s sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Bethaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47:</span>So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48:</span>And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49:</span>Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50:</span>And the name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51:</span>And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52:</span>And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.</p>

<h3>Chapter 15</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD’s anointed is before him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which is with the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And the staff of his spear was like a weaver’s beam; and his spear’s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father’s house free in Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And David said to Saul, Let no man’s heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father’s sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd’s bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47:</span>And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD’s, and he will give you into our hands.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48:</span>And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49:</span>And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50:</span>So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51:</span>Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52:</span>And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53:</span>And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54:</span>And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55:</span>And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56:</span>And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57:</span>And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">58:</span>And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.</p>

<h3>Chapter 18</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father’s house.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul’s servants.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul’s hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD’s battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father’s family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul’s daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And Michal Saul’s daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And Saul’s servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king’s son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king’s enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king’s son in law: and the days were not expired.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king’s son in law.

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal Saul’s daughter loved him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David’s enemy continually.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>But Jonathan Saul’s son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin, but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Saul also sent messengers unto David’s house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David’s wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats’ hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats’ hair for his bolster.</p>

<h3>Chapter 20</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father answer thee roughly?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David’s enemies.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul’s side, and David’s place was empty.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David’s place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king’s table.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother’s nakedness?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever.

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of bread in mine hand, or what there is present.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me?</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king’s son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me.

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee.

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And it came to pass afterward, that David’s heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul’s skirt.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert of the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.</p>

<h3>Chapter 26</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD’s anointed, and be guiltless?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD’s anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul’s bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD’s anointed. And now see where the king’s spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And Saul knew David’s voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And David answered and said, Behold the king’s spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD’s anointed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>The song of songs, which is Solomon’s.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother’s children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds’ tents.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh’s chariots.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with chains of gold.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves’ eyes.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed is green.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves’ eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them.</p>
