<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king’s seed, and of the princes;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king’s palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king’s meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king’s meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king’s meat.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-daniel-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king’s matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>He answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king’s matter.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>This image’s head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47:</span>The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48:</span>Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49:</span>Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king’s counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my God, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen.

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>While the word was in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles’ feathers, and his nails like birds’ claws.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man’s heart was given to it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And I heard a man’s voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:</p>

<h3>Chapter 10</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king’s daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened by it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers’ fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And both these kings’ hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits, and return to his own land.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many days.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt offerings morning and evening.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required;</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, and to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be with thee: be of good courage, and do it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they sware.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives: namely, of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD because of the Midianites,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and gave you their land;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And I said unto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it Jehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Take thy father’s young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his father’s household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the other people go every man unto his place.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man’s hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man’s sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan.

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49:</span>And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken thereto.

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD’s, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpeh.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>(And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was near them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valour.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47:</span>But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48:</span>And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the LORD?

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father’s house have sinned.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers’ sepulchres, that I may build it.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king’s words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return unto us they will be upon you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the LORD, which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one put them off for washing.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king’s tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.</p>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>Nevertheless for thy great mercies’ sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, were written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise and to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward over against ward.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of Netophathi;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks, whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And certain of the priests’ sons with trumpets; namely, Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against them, and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47:</span>And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified holy things unto the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them unto the children of Aaron.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-nehemiah-13">
<h3>Chapter 13</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office was to distribute unto their brethren.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews’ language, but according to the language of each people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.</p>

<p class="private-message">Στην οικογένειά μου και τον Θεό που μας καθοδηγεί. Inspired by a conversation on Degen Saturdays between @AdrianDittmann and @T_Bilderberg. Revelations Chapter 20: 1-3 "And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season".
