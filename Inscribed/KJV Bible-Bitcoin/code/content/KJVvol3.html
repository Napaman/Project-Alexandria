<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good unto you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubims, whose name is called on it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Wherefore Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord’s servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And the LORD spake unto Gad, David’s seer, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose thee</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Either three years’ famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father’s house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season in the high place at Gibeon.</p>

<h3>Chapter 29</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the LORD God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses withal:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the LORD?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king’s work, offered willingly,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Thine, O LORD, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine own.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have made provision.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto the LORD to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This is an ordinance for ever to Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And the house which I build is great: for great is our God above all gods.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build shall be wonderful great.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath made thee king over them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father’s,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 chronicles-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the walls.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work, and overlaid them with gold.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long: one wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were inward.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; and it received and held three thousand baths.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basons of gold.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side.

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the king’s hand.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla.

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said, Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do even so.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel.

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was Zibiah of Beersheba.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And at the king’s commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king’s office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king’s scribe and the high priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to offer withal, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver.

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The LORD look upon it, and require it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand?</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of Edom.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>That prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept other seven days with gladness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place, even unto heaven.</p>

Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>He appointed also the king’s portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared them,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was the next.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they did help him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying,</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand?</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria.

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.</p>

<h3>Chapter 34</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the right hand, nor to the left.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and amend the house:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and other of the Levites, all that could skill of instruments of musick.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king’s, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that effect.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.</p>

<h3>Chapter 35</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after the division of the families of the Levites.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king’s substance.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle, and three hundred oxen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king’s commandment.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all the people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that he destroy thee not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to that which was written in the law of the LORD,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.</p>

<h3>Chapter 36</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father’s stead in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the LORD God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till there was no remedy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age: he gave them all into his hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon.</p>
