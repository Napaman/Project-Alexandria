<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces of Benhadad.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour the palaces thereof:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon, and I will turn mine hand against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus, which shall devour the palaces thereof.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>But I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they might enlarge their border:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, saith the LORD.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-amos-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kirioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the same maid, to profane my holy name:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the LORD.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Can two walk together, except they be agreed?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin is for him? shall one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done it?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD hath spoken, who can but prophesy?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof, and the oppressed in the midst thereof.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For they know not to do right, saith the LORD, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; An adversary there shall be even round about the land; and he shall bring down thy strength from thee, and thy palaces shall be spoiled.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Thus saith the LORD; As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus in a couch.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord GOD, the God of hosts,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>That in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of Bethel: and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, saith the LORD.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And ye shall go out at the breaches, every cow at that which is before her; and ye shall cast them into the palace, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes after three years:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim and publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And also I have withholden the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>So two or three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the palmerworm devoured them: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: and because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Hear ye this word which I take up against you, even a lamentation, O house of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nought.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Bethel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an evil time.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD, saith thus; Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through thee, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts.</p>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, which are named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>That chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves instruments of musick, like David;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And a man’s uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with thee? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>For, behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plow there with oxen? for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hemath unto the river of the wilderness.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet’s son; but I was an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac.</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>I saw the LORD standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And the Lord GOD of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise up wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>It is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old:</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Therefore saith the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And the idols he shall utterly abolish.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of Judah, and took them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller’s field.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah’s son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph’s son, the recorder.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>I say, sayest thou, (but they are but vain words) I have counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is it not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The LORD will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king’s commandment was, saying, Answer him not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD, and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to reproach the living God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>This is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>For thy Maker is thine husband; the LORD of hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the LORD thy Redeemer.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>For this is as the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And all thy children shall be taught of the LORD; and great shall be the peace of thy children.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>In transgressing and lying against the LORD, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed’s seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>For Adam was first formed, then Eve.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>These things command and teach.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But godliness with contentment is great gain.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.</p>

<p class="private-message">Στην οικογένειά μου και τον Θεό που μας καθοδηγεί. Inspired by a conversation on Degen Saturdays between @AdrianDittmann and @T_Bilderberg. Revelations Chapter 20: 1-3 "And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season".
