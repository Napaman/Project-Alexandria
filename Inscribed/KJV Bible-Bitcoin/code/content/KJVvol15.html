<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to meet you, and told you these words?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said unto him, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, and the ground barren.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 kings-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy horses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days’ journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel’s servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 kings-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her: and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was a leper.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman’s wife.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules’ burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his hand, and took it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he led them to Samaria.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass’s head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove’s dung for five pieces of silver.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer?</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be mine, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master’s sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time.

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king’s sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they made him ride in his chariot.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spake to Elijah.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of him.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel;</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Bethel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba, and brake down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man’s left hand at the gate of the city.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and brake them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he brake down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God, which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Bethel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars, and burned men’s bones upon them, and returned to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto the LORD your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this passover was holden to the LORD in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaohnechoh.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</p>

<p class="private-message">Στην οικογένειά μου και τον Θεό που μας καθοδηγεί. Inspired by a conversation on Degen Saturdays between @AdrianDittmann and @T_Bilderberg. Revelations Chapter 20: 1-3 "And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season".
