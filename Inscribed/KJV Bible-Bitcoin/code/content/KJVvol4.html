<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the church:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>(Touch not; taste not; handle not;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-colossians-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>For which things’ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>That no flesh should glory in his presence.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, ye are God’s building.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man’s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>We are fools for Christ’s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father’s wife.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.</p>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord’s freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ’s servant.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>But if any man love God, the same is known of him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol’s temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And did all eat the same spiritual meat;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of devils.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Let no man seek his own, but every man another’s wealth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>For the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man’s conscience?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.</p>

<h3>Chapter 11</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord’s supper.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.</p>

<h3>Chapter 12</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>For the body is not one member, but many.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And if they were all one member, where were the body?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>But now are they many members, yet but one body.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.</p>

<h3>Chapter 13</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.</p>

<h3>Chapter 14</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.</p>

<h3>Chapter 15</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our LORD, I die daily.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47:</span>The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48:</span>As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49:</span>And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50:</span>Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51:</span>Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52:</span>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53:</span>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54:</span>So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55:</span>O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56:</span>The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57:</span>But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">58:</span>Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.</p>
</div>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ’s gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 corinthians-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 corinthians-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus’ sake.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>So then death worketh in us, but life in you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Greet one another with an holy kiss.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>All the saints salute you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ minister, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD’s servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an harlot’s house, named Rahab, and lodged there.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my father’s house, and give me a true token:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father’s household, home unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell them:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the LORD of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon an heap.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests’ feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all his banks, as they did before.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over:</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And the captain of the LORD’s host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.</p>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams’ horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east side of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country.  And the men went up and viewed Ai.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labour thither; for they are but few.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>O LORD, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave’s mouth, which remain until this very day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto your tents, and unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their tents.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan: but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward.

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to see to.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying,</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD, wherein the LORD’s tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against the LORD: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name’s sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan’s seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And I will give him the morning star.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.</p>

<h3>Chapter 17</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.</p>
