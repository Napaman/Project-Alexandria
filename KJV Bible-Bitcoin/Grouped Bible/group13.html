<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:</p>
<p class="verse">And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</p>
<p class="verse">And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</p>
<p class="verse">But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.</p>
<p class="verse">And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.</p>
<p class="verse">And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?</p>
<p class="verse">So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.</p>
<p class="verse">And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.</p>
<p class="verse">Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.</p>
<p class="verse">And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.</p>
<p class="verse">And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.</p>
<p class="verse">And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</p>
<p class="verse">But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.</p>
<p class="verse">And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.</p>
<p class="verse">And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 samuel-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.</p>
<p class="verse">There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our God.</p>
<p class="verse">Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.</p>
<p class="verse">The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.</p>
<p class="verse">They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.</p>
<p class="verse">He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORDâ€™s, and he hath set the world upon them.</p>
<p class="verse">He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.</p>
<p class="verse">The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priestsâ€™ custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priestâ€™s servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;</p>
<p class="verse">And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.</p>
<p class="verse">Also before they burnt the fat, the priestâ€™s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.</p>
<p class="verse">And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</p>
<p class="verse">And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.</p>
<p class="verse">Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORDâ€™s people to transgress.</p>
<p class="verse">If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.</p>
<p class="verse">And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.</p>
<p class="verse">And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaohâ€™s house?</p>
<p class="verse">And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy fatherâ€™s house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.</p>
<p class="verse">And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priestsâ€™ offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 samuel-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;</p>
<p class="verse">And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;</p>
<p class="verse">That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.</p>
<p class="verse">And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.</p>
<p class="verse">Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</p>
<p class="verse">In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.</p>
<p class="verse">For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.</p>
<p class="verse">And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eliâ€™s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.</p>
<p class="verse">And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 samuel-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.</p>
<p class="verse">So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.</p>
<p class="verse">Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse">Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.</p>
<p class="verse">And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.</p>
<p class="verse">And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.</p>
<p class="verse">Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.</p>
<p class="verse">And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?</p>
<p class="verse">And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.</p>
<p class="verse">And his daughter in law, Phinehasâ€™ wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.</p>
<p class="verse">And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it.</p>
<p class="verse">And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.</p>
<p class="verse">And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 samuel-5">
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod.</p>
<p class="verse">When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagonâ€™s house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse">But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.</p>
<p class="verse">They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.</p>
<p class="verse">So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.</p>
<p class="verse">And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 samuel-6">
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse">And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place.</p>
<p class="verse">And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:</p>
<p class="verse">And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.</p>
<p class="verse">And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it was a chance that happened to us.</p>
<p class="verse">And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:</p>
<p class="verse">And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.</p>
<p class="verse">And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Bethshemesh.</p>
<p class="verse">And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.</p>
<p class="verse">And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.</p>
<p class="verse">And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;</p>
<p class="verse">And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country villages, even unto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua, the Bethshemite.</p>
<p class="verse">And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.</p>
<p class="verse">And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?</p>
<p class="verse">And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 samuel-7">
<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="verse">And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.</p>
<p class="verse">And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD for Israel; and the LORD heard him.</p>
<p class="verse">And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helped us.</p>
<p class="verse">So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.</p>
<p class="verse">And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.</p>
<p class="verse">And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.</p>
<p class="verse">And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the LORD.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 samuel-8">
<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.</p>
<p class="verse">And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.</p>
<p class="verse">Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,</p>
<p class="verse">And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.</p>
<p class="verse">But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.</p>
<p class="verse">According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.</p>
<p class="verse">And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.</p>
<p class="verse">And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.</p>
<p class="verse">And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.</p>
<p class="verse">And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.</p>
<p class="verse">And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.</p>
<p class="verse">He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;</p>
<p class="verse">That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
<p class="verse">Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.</p>
<p class="verse">And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.</p>
<p class="verse">And the asses of Kish Saulâ€™s father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.</p>
<p class="verse">And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?</p>
<p class="verse">And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.</p>
<p class="verse">(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was.</p>
<p class="verse">And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?</p>
<p class="verse">And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:</p>
<p class="verse">As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.</p>
<p class="verse">And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seerâ€™s house is.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart.</p>
<p class="verse">And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy fatherâ€™s house?</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.</p>
<p class="verse">And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.</p>
<p class="verse">And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on), but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 samuel-10">
<h3>Chapter 10</h3>
<p class="verse">Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?</p>
<p class="verse">When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachelâ€™s sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?</p>
<p class="verse">Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:</p>
<p class="verse">And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands.</p>
<p class="verse">After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:</p>
<p class="verse">And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.</p>
<p class="verse">And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?</p>
<p class="verse">And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saulâ€™s uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no where, we came to Samuel.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saulâ€™s uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;</p>
<p class="verse">And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:</p>
<p class="verse">And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.</p>
<p class="verse">When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff.</p>
<p class="verse">And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.</p>
<p class="verse">But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his peace.</p>

<h3>Chapter 11</h3>
<p class="verse">Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven daysâ€™ respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.</p>
<p class="verse">And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by that time the sun be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.</p>
<p class="verse">And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 samuel-12">
<h3>Chapter 12</h3>
<p class="verse">And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you.</p>
<p class="verse">And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.</p>
<p class="verse">And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any manâ€™s hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand. And they answered, He is witness.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.</p>
<p class="verse">And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe.</p>
<p class="verse">And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.</p>
<p class="verse">If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God:</p>
<p class="verse">But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes.</p>
<p class="verse">Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king.</p>
<p class="verse">So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart;</p>
<p class="verse">And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.</p>
<p class="verse">For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great nameâ€™s sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:</p>
<p class="verse">Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.</p>
<p class="verse">But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.</p>

<h3>Chapter 13</h3>
<p class="verse">Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,</p>
<p class="verse">Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.</p>
<p class="verse">And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.</p>
<p class="verse">When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.</p>
<p class="verse">And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.</p>
<p class="verse">And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.</p>
<p class="verse">And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:</p>
<p class="verse">And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse">Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:</p>
<p class="verse">But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.</p>
<p class="verse">So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.</p>
<p class="verse">And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.</p>

<h3>Chapter 14</h3>
<p class="verse">Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistinesâ€™ garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his father.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;</p>
<p class="verse">And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabodâ€™s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORDâ€™s priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.</p>
<p class="verse">And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistinesâ€™ garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.</p>
<p class="verse">The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.</p>
<p class="verse">And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us.</p>
<p class="verse">And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.</p>
<p class="verse">And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.</p>
<p class="verse">And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.</p>
<p class="verse">And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.</p>
<p class="verse">And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every manâ€™s sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.</p>
<p class="verse">So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Bethaven.</p>
<p class="verse">And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.</p>
<p class="verse">And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.</p>
<p class="verse">Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.</p>
<p class="verse">How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?</p>
<p class="verse">And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.</p>
<p class="verse">And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood.</p>
<p class="verse">Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.</p>
<p class="verse">For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.</p>
<p class="verse">And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.</p>
<p class="verse">So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.</p>
<p class="verse">And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:</p>
<p class="verse">And the name of Saulâ€™s wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saulâ€™s uncle.</p>
<p class="verse">And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.</p>
<p class="verse">And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 samuel-15">
<h3>Chapter 15</h3>
<p class="verse">Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse">Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.</p>
<p class="verse">But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.</p>
<p class="verse">Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</p>
<p class="verse">But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.</p>
<p class="verse">For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou.</p>
<p class="verse">And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.</p>
<p class="verse">Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.</p>
<p class="verse">So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 samuel-16">
<h3>Chapter 16</h3>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORDâ€™s anointed is before him.</p>
<p class="verse">But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.</p>
<p class="verse">Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.</p>
<p class="verse">And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.</p>
<p class="verse">But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saulâ€™s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.</p>
<p class="verse">Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which is with the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.</p>
<p class="verse">And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 samuel-17">
<h3>Chapter 17</h3>
<p class="verse">Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.</p>
<p class="verse">And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.</p>
<p class="verse">And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.</p>
<p class="verse">And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders.</p>
<p class="verse">And the staff of his spear was like a weaverâ€™s beam; and his spearâ€™s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.</p>
<p class="verse">If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.</p>
<p class="verse">When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.</p>
<p class="verse">Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.</p>
<p class="verse">And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.</p>
<p class="verse">And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.</p>
<p class="verse">But David went and returned from Saul to feed his fatherâ€™s sheep at Bethlehem.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren.</p>
<p class="verse">And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.</p>
<p class="verse">Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.</p>
<p class="verse">And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.</p>
<p class="verse">For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.</p>
<p class="verse">And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.</p>
<p class="verse">And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.</p>
<p class="verse">And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his fatherâ€™s house free in Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?</p>
<p class="verse">And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliabâ€™s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?</p>
<p class="verse">And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said to Saul, Let no manâ€™s heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his fatherâ€™s sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:</p>
<p class="verse">And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.</p>
<p class="verse">Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.</p>
<p class="verse">David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.</p>
<p class="verse">And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherdâ€™s bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.</p>
<p class="verse">This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORDâ€™s, and he will give you into our hands.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.</p>
<p class="verse">And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.</p>
<p class="verse">And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.</p>
<p class="verse">And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.</p>
<p class="verse">And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.</p>
<p class="verse">And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.</p>

<h3>Chapter 18</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his fatherâ€™s house.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.</p>
<p class="verse">And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saulâ€™s servants.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick.</p>
<p class="verse">And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saulâ€™s hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.</p>
<p class="verse">And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.</p>
<p class="verse">But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORDâ€™s battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my fatherâ€™s family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?</p>
<p class="verse">But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saulâ€™s daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.</p>
<p class="verse">And Michal Saulâ€™s daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the kingâ€™s son in law.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saulâ€™s servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a kingâ€™s son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?</p>
<p class="verse">And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the kingâ€™s enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.</p>
<p class="verse">And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the kingâ€™s son in law: and the days were not expired.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the kingâ€™s son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal Saulâ€™s daughter loved him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became Davidâ€™s enemy continually.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 samuel-19">
<h3>Chapter 19</h3>
<p class="verse">And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jonathan Saulâ€™s son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:</p>
<p class="verse">And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good:</p>
<p class="verse">For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.</p>
<p class="verse">And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.</p>
<p class="verse">And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin, but he slipped away out of Saulâ€™s presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.</p>
<p class="verse">Saul also sent messengers unto Davidâ€™s house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal Davidâ€™s wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.</p>
<p class="verse">So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.</p>
<p class="verse">And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goatsâ€™ hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goatsâ€™ hair for his bolster.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?</p>
<p class="verse">So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.</p>
<p class="verse">And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.</p>
<p class="verse">Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.</p>
<p class="verse">And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.</p>
<p class="verse">And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 samuel-20">
<h3>Chapter 20</h3>
<p class="verse">And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.</p>
<p class="verse">And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.</p>
<p class="verse">If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.</p>
<p class="verse">If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?</p>
<p class="verse">And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?</p>
<p class="verse">Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father answer thee roughly?</p>
<p class="verse">And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:</p>
<p class="verse">But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of Davidâ€™s enemies.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.</p>
<p class="verse">And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth.</p>
<p class="verse">But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.</p>
<p class="verse">And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saulâ€™s side, and Davidâ€™s place was empty.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that Davidâ€™s place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?</p>
<p class="verse">And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the kingâ€™s table.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Saulâ€™s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy motherâ€™s nakedness?</p>
<p class="verse">For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.</p>
<p class="verse">So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?</p>
<p class="verse">And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathanâ€™s lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.</p>
<p class="verse">But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.</p>
<p class="verse">And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 samuel-21">
<h3>Chapter 21</h3>
<p class="verse">Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?</p>
<p class="verse">And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of bread in mine hand, or what there is present.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.</p>
<p class="verse">And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.</p>
<p class="verse">So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.</p>
<p class="verse">Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the kingâ€™s business required haste.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.</p>
<p class="verse">And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.</p>
<p class="verse">And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</p>
<p class="verse">And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.</p>
<p class="verse">And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me?</p>
<p class="verse">Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 samuel-22">
<h3>Chapter 22</h3>
<p class="verse">David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his fatherâ€™s house heard it, they went down thither to him.</p>
<p class="verse">And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.</p>
<p class="verse">And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.</p>
<p class="verse">And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.</p>
<p class="verse">And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.</p>
<p class="verse">When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)</p>
<p class="verse">Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;</p>
<p class="verse">That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?</p>
<p class="verse">Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.</p>
<p class="verse">And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his fatherâ€™s house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?</p>
<p class="verse">Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the kingâ€™s son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?</p>
<p class="verse">Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy fatherâ€™s house.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.</p>
<p class="verse">And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.</p>
<p class="verse">And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.</p>
<p class="verse">And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORDâ€™s priests.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy fatherâ€™s house.</p>
<p class="verse">Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.</p>

<h3>Chapter 23</h3>
<p class="verse">Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.</p>
<p class="verse">And Davidâ€™s men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?</p>
<p class="verse">Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand.</p>
<p class="verse">So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.</p>
<p class="verse">And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.</p>
<p class="verse">Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver thee up.</p>
<p class="verse">Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth.</p>
<p class="verse">And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jonathan Saulâ€™s son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.</p>
<p class="verse">And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.</p>
<p class="verse">Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the kingâ€™s hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me.</p>
<p class="verse">Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly.</p>
<p class="verse">See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.</p>
<p class="verse">Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David: wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.</p>
<p class="verse">But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth.</p>
<p class="verse">And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at Engedi.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 samuel-24">
<h3>Chapter 24</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.</p>
<p class="verse">And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.</p>
<p class="verse">And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saulâ€™s robe privily.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass afterward, that Davidâ€™s heart smote him, because he had cut off Saulâ€™s skirt.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORDâ€™s anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.</p>
<p class="verse">David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou menâ€™s words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the LORDâ€™s anointed.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.</p>
<p class="verse">As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.</p>
<p class="verse">After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not.</p>
<p class="verse">For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day.</p>
<p class="verse">And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.</p>
<p class="verse">Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my fatherâ€™s house.</p>
<p class="verse">And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 samuel-25">
<h3>Chapter 25</h3>
<p class="verse">And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.</p>
<p class="verse">And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.</p>
<p class="verse">And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.</p>
<p class="verse">And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:</p>
<p class="verse">And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou hast.</p>
<p class="verse">And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.</p>
<p class="verse">Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Davidâ€™s young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.</p>
<p class="verse">And Nabal answered Davidâ€™s servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.</p>
<p class="verse">Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?</p>
<p class="verse">So Davidâ€™s young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.</p>
<p class="verse">But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabalâ€™s wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them.</p>
<p class="verse">But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:</p>
<p class="verse">They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.</p>
<p class="verse">And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert of the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them.</p>
<p class="verse">Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good.</p>
<p class="verse">So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,</p>
<p class="verse">And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.</p>
<p class="verse">Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.</p>
<p class="verse">And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.</p>
<p class="verse">I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;</p>
<p class="verse">That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me:</p>
<p class="verse">And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.</p>
<p class="verse">For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.</p>
<p class="verse">So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.</p>
<p class="verse">And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabalâ€™s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.</p>
<p class="verse">But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died.</p>
<p class="verse">And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife.</p>
<p class="verse">And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.</p>
<p class="verse">And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.</p>
<p class="verse">David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.</p>
<p class="verse">But Saul had given Michal his daughter, Davidâ€™s wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 samuel-26">
<h3>Chapter 26</h3>
<p class="verse">And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?</p>
<p class="verse">Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse">David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.</p>
<p class="verse">And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.</p>
<p class="verse">So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORDâ€™s anointed, and be guiltless?</p>
<p class="verse">David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORDâ€™s anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.</p>
<p class="verse">So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saulâ€™s bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.</p>
<p class="verse">Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:</p>
<p class="verse">And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king?</p>
<p class="verse">And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.</p>
<p class="verse">This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORDâ€™s anointed. And now see where the kingâ€™s spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul knew Davidâ€™s voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.</p>
<p class="verse">And David answered and said, Behold the kingâ€™s spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORDâ€™s anointed.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 samuel-27">
<h3>Chapter 27</h3>
<p class="verse">And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.</p>
<p class="verse">And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabalâ€™s wife.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?</p>
<p class="verse">Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse">And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.</p>
<p class="verse">And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse">And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.</p>
<p class="verse">And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.</p>
<p class="verse">And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines.</p>
<p class="verse">And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 samuel-28">
<h3>Chapter 28</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.</p>
<p class="verse">And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to David:</p>
<p class="verse">Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.</p>
<p class="verse">And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.</p>
<p class="verse">But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.</p>
<p class="verse">And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:</p>
<p class="verse">And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 samuel-29">
<h3>Chapter 29</h3>
<p class="verse">Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel.</p>
<p class="verse">And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day?</p>
<p class="verse">And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with the heads of these men?</p>
<p class="verse">Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</p>
<p class="verse">Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?</p>
<p class="verse">And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy masterâ€™s servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart.</p>
<p class="verse">So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 samuel-30">
<h3>Chapter 30</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;</p>
<p class="verse">And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their way.</p>
<p class="verse">So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.</p>
<p class="verse">Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.</p>
<p class="verse">And Davidâ€™s two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</p>
<p class="verse">And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelechâ€™s son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.</p>
<p class="verse">And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.</p>
<p class="verse">So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.</p>
<p class="verse">But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.</p>
<p class="verse">And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;</p>
<p class="verse">And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick.</p>
<p class="verse">We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.</p>
<p class="verse">And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives.</p>
<p class="verse">And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all.</p>
<p class="verse">And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave before those other cattle, and said, This is Davidâ€™s spoil.</p>
<p class="verse">And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.</p>
<p class="verse">Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand.</p>
<p class="verse">For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse">And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;</p>
<p class="verse">To them which were in Bethel, and to them which were in south Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir,</p>
<p class="verse">And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa,</p>
<p class="verse">And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites,</p>
<p class="verse">And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in Chorashan, and to them which were in Athach,</p>
<p class="verse">And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 samuel-31">
<h3>Chapter 31</h3>
<p class="verse">Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua, Saulâ€™s sons.</p>
<p class="verse">And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.</p>
<p class="verse">And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him.</p>
<p class="verse">So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.</p>
<p class="verse">And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people.</p>
<p class="verse">And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;</p>
<p class="verse">All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.</p>
<p class="verse">And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</p>
<p class="verse">Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;</p>
<p class="verse">And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;</p>
<p class="verse">And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;</p>
<p class="verse">And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;</p>
<p class="verse">And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;</p>
<p class="verse">And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;</p>
<p class="verse">And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;</p>
<p class="verse">And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:</p>
<p class="verse">And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;</p>
<p class="verse">And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;</p>
<p class="verse">And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;</p>
<p class="verse">And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;</p>
<p class="verse">And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.</p>
<p class="verse">But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse">And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.</p>
<p class="verse">Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:</p>
<p class="verse">And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-matthew-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.</p>
<p class="verse">When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.</p>
<p class="verse">And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,</p>
<p class="verse">And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.</p>
<p class="verse">And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.</p>
<p class="verse">When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.</p>
<p class="verse">When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.</p>
<p class="verse">And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.</p>
<p class="verse">When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:</p>
<p class="verse">And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.</p>
<p class="verse">Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</p>
<p class="verse">But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young childâ€™s life.</p>
<p class="verse">And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:</p>
<p class="verse">And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-matthew-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,</p>
<p class="verse">And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p>
<p class="verse">For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</p>
<p class="verse">And the same John had his raiment of camelâ€™s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.</p>
<p class="verse">Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,</p>
<p class="verse">And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>
<p class="verse">But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</p>
<p class="verse">Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:</p>
<p class="verse">And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.</p>
<p class="verse">And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</p>
<p class="verse">I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:</p>
<p class="verse">Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</p>
<p class="verse">Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.</p>
<p class="verse">But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:</p>
<p class="verse">And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-matthew-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.</p>
<p class="verse">But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,</p>
<p class="verse">And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</p>
<p class="verse">Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;</p>
<p class="verse">And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.</p>
<p class="verse">Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.</p>
<p class="verse">Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;</p>
<p class="verse">And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:</p>
<p class="verse">That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;</p>
<p class="verse">The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.</p>
<p class="verse">From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</p>
<p class="verse">And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</p>
<p class="verse">And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.</p>
<p class="verse">And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.</p>
<p class="verse">And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.</p>
<p class="verse">And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.</p>
<p class="verse">And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-matthew-5">
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:</p>
<p class="verse">And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousnessâ€™ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.</p>
<p class="verse">Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.</p>
<p class="verse">Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.</p>
<p class="verse">Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.</p>
<p class="verse">For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="verse">Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:</p>
<p class="verse">But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;</p>
<p class="verse">Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</p>
<p class="verse">Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.</p>
<p class="verse">Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:</p>
<p class="verse">But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.</p>
<p class="verse">And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</p>
<p class="verse">And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</p>
<p class="verse">It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:</p>
<p class="verse">But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.</p>
<p class="verse">Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:</p>
<p class="verse">But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is Godâ€™s throne:</p>
<p class="verse">Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.</p>
<p class="verse">Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.</p>
<p class="verse">But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:</p>
<p class="verse">But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.</p>
<p class="verse">And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.</p>
<p class="verse">And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.</p>
<p class="verse">Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.</p>
<p class="verse">But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;</p>
<p class="verse">That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.</p>
<p class="verse">For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?</p>
<p class="verse">And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?</p>
<p class="verse">Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-matthew-6">
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse">Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</p>
<p class="verse">But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:</p>
<p class="verse">That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.</p>
<p class="verse">And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</p>
<p class="verse">But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</p>
<p class="verse">But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</p>
<p class="verse">Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.</p>
<p class="verse">After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.</p>
<p class="verse">Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">Give us this day our daily bread.</p>
<p class="verse">And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</p>
<p class="verse">And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</p>
<p class="verse">But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</p>
<p class="verse">But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;</p>
<p class="verse">That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</p>
<p class="verse">Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</p>
<p class="verse">But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</p>
<p class="verse">For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</p>
<p class="verse">The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.</p>
<p class="verse">But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!</p>
<p class="verse">No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</p>
<p class="verse">Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?</p>
<p class="verse">Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?</p>
<p class="verse">And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:</p>
<p class="verse">And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?</p>
<p class="verse">(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</p>
<p class="verse">But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="verse">Judge not, that ye be not judged.</p>
<p class="verse">For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.</p>
<p class="verse">And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brotherâ€™s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</p>
<p class="verse">Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?</p>
<p class="verse">Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brotherâ€™s eye.</p>
<p class="verse">Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.</p>
<p class="verse">Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:</p>
<p class="verse">For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</p>
<p class="verse">Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?</p>
<p class="verse">Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?</p>
<p class="verse">If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse">Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:</p>
<p class="verse">Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</p>
<p class="verse">Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheepâ€™s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?</p>
<p class="verse">Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</p>
<p class="verse">A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</p>
<p class="verse">Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.</p>
<p class="verse">Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?</p>
<p class="verse">And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:</p>
<p class="verse">And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.</p>
<p class="verse">And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:</p>
<p class="verse">And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:</p>
<p class="verse">For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-matthew-8">
<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="verse">When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,</p>
<p class="verse">And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.</p>
<p class="verse">The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.</p>
<p class="verse">For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.</p>
<p class="verse">When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Jesus was come into Peterâ€™s house, he saw his wifeâ€™s mother laid, and sick of a fever.</p>
<p class="verse">And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick:</p>
<p class="verse">That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.</p>
<p class="verse">Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side.</p>
<p class="verse">And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</p>
<p class="verse">And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.</p>
<p class="verse">And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish.</p>
<p class="verse">And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.</p>
<p class="verse">But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?</p>
<p class="verse">And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding.</p>
<p class="verse">So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.</p>
<p class="verse">And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-matthew-9">
<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
<p class="verse">And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?</p>
<p class="verse">For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?</p>
<p class="verse">But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.</p>
<p class="verse">And he arose, and departed to his house.</p>
<p class="verse">But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God, which had given such power unto men.</p>
<p class="verse">And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?</p>
<p class="verse">But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.</p>
<p class="verse">But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</p>
<p class="verse">Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.</p>
<p class="verse">No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse.</p>
<p class="verse">Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.</p>
<p class="verse">While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:</p>
<p class="verse">For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Jesus came into the rulerâ€™s house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,</p>
<p class="verse">He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.</p>
<p class="verse">But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.</p>
<p class="verse">And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See that no man know it.</p>
<p class="verse">But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.</p>
<p class="verse">As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.</p>
<p class="verse">But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.</p>
<p class="verse">Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few;</p>
<p class="verse">Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-matthew-10">
<h3>Chapter 10</h3>
<p class="verse">And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;</p>
<p class="verse">Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;</p>
<p class="verse">Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</p>
<p class="verse">These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not:</p>
<p class="verse">But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p>
<p class="verse">Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.</p>
<p class="verse">Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,</p>
<p class="verse">Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.</p>
<p class="verse">And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.</p>
<p class="verse">And when ye come into an house, salute it.</p>
<p class="verse">And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.</p>
<p class="verse">And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.</p>
<p class="verse">Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.</p>
<p class="verse">But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="verse">But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.</p>
<p class="verse">For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.</p>
<p class="verse">And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall be hated of all men for my nameâ€™s sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.</p>
<p class="verse">But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.</p>
<p class="verse">The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.</p>
<p class="verse">It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?</p>
<p class="verse">Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.</p>
<p class="verse">What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.</p>
<p class="verse">And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.</p>
<p class="verse">Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.</p>
<p class="verse">But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</p>
<p class="verse">Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.</p>
<p class="verse">Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.</p>
<p class="verse">For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.</p>
<p class="verse">And a manâ€™s foes shall be they of his own household.</p>
<p class="verse">He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.</p>
<p class="verse">And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.</p>
<p class="verse">He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.</p>
<p class="verse">He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.</p>
<p class="verse">He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophetâ€™s reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous manâ€™s reward.</p>
<p class="verse">And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-matthew-11">
<h3>Chapter 11</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.</p>
<p class="verse">Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,</p>
<p class="verse">And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see:</p>
<p class="verse">The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.</p>
<p class="verse">And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</p>
<p class="verse">And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</p>
<p class="verse">But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kingsâ€™ houses.</p>
<p class="verse">But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.</p>
<p class="verse">For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</p>
<p class="verse">And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</p>
<p class="verse">For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.</p>
<p class="verse">And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.</p>
<p class="verse">He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p class="verse">But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,</p>
<p class="verse">And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.</p>
<p class="verse">For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil.</p>
<p class="verse">The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.</p>
<p class="verse">Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:</p>
<p class="verse">Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</p>
<p class="verse">But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.</p>
<p class="verse">But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.</p>
<p class="verse">At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.</p>
<p class="verse">Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.</p>
<p class="verse">All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.</p>
<p class="verse">Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</p>
<p class="verse">Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</p>
<p class="verse">For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</p>

<h3>Chapter 12</h3>
<p class="verse">At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat.</p>
<p class="verse">But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.</p>
<p class="verse">But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him;</p>
<p class="verse">How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?</p>
<p class="verse">Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?</p>
<p class="verse">But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple.</p>
<p class="verse">But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.</p>
<p class="verse">For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?</p>
<p class="verse">How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.</p>
<p class="verse">Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.</p>
<p class="verse">But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;</p>
<p class="verse">And charged them that they should not make him known:</p>
<p class="verse">That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="verse">He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.</p>
<p class="verse">A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.</p>
<p class="verse">And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.</p>
<p class="verse">Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?</p>
<p class="verse">But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:</p>
<p class="verse">And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?</p>
<p class="verse">And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.</p>
<p class="verse">But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">Or else how can one enter into a strong manâ€™s house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.</p>
<p class="verse">He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.</p>
<p class="verse">And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</p>
<p class="verse">Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit.</p>
<p class="verse">O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</p>
<p class="verse">A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.</p>
<p class="verse">But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.</p>
<p class="verse">For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.</p>
<p class="verse">Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.</p>
<p class="verse">But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:</p>
<p class="verse">For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whaleâ€™s belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.</p>
<p class="verse">The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.</p>
<p class="verse">When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.</p>
<p class="verse">Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.</p>
<p class="verse">Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.</p>
<p class="verse">While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.</p>
<p class="verse">But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?</p>
<p class="verse">And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!</p>
<p class="verse">For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.</p>

<h3>Chapter 13</h3>
<p class="verse">The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.</p>
<p class="verse">And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.</p>
<p class="verse">And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;</p>
<p class="verse">And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:</p>
<p class="verse">Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:</p>
<p class="verse">And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.</p>
<p class="verse">And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:</p>
<p class="verse">But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.</p>
<p class="verse">Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p class="verse">And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?</p>
<p class="verse">He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.</p>
<p class="verse">For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.</p>
<p class="verse">And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:</p>
<p class="verse">For this peopleâ€™s heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</p>
<p class="verse">But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.</p>
<p class="verse">For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</p>
<p class="verse">Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.</p>
<p class="verse">When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.</p>
<p class="verse">But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;</p>
<p class="verse">Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.</p>
<p class="verse">He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.</p>
<p class="verse">But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</p>
<p class="verse">Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:</p>
<p class="verse">But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.</p>
<p class="verse">But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.</p>
<p class="verse">So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?</p>
<p class="verse">He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</p>
<p class="verse">But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.</p>
<p class="verse">Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</p>
<p class="verse">Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:</p>
<p class="verse">Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</p>
<p class="verse">All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:</p>
<p class="verse">That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.</p>
<p class="verse">He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;</p>
<p class="verse">The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;</p>
<p class="verse">The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</p>
<p class="verse">As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.</p>
<p class="verse">The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;</p>
<p class="verse">And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p class="verse">Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p class="verse">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</p>
<p class="verse">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:</p>
<p class="verse">Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</p>
<p class="verse">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:</p>
<p class="verse">Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.</p>
<p class="verse">So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,</p>
<p class="verse">And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?</p>
<p class="verse">Is not this the carpenterâ€™s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?</p>
<p class="verse">And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?</p>
<p class="verse">And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.</p>
<p class="verse">And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-matthew-14">
<h3>Chapter 14</h3>
<p class="verse">At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,</p>
<p class="verse">And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.</p>
<p class="verse">For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodiasâ€™ sake, his brother Philipâ€™s wife.</p>
<p class="verse">For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.</p>
<p class="verse">But when Herodâ€™s birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.</p>
<p class="verse">Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask.</p>
<p class="verse">And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptistâ€™s head in a charger.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oathâ€™s sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.</p>
<p class="verse">And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.</p>
<p class="verse">And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.</p>
<p class="verse">And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.</p>
<p class="verse">And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.</p>
<p class="verse">And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.</p>
<p class="verse">He said, Bring them hither to me.</p>
<p class="verse">And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</p>
<p class="verse">And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.</p>
<p class="verse">And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.</p>
<p class="verse">And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.</p>
<p class="verse">But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.</p>
<p class="verse">And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.</p>
<p class="verse">But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.</p>
<p class="verse">And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.</p>
<p class="verse">And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?</p>
<p class="verse">And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.</p>
<p class="verse">Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;</p>
<p class="verse">And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-matthew-15">
<h3>Chapter 15</h3>
<p class="verse">Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</p>
<p class="verse">But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?</p>
<p class="verse">For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.</p>
<p class="verse">But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;</p>
<p class="verse">And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.</p>
<p class="verse">But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</p>
<p class="verse">And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:</p>
<p class="verse">Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</p>
<p class="verse">Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?</p>
<p class="verse">But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</p>
<p class="verse">Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</p>
<p class="verse">Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?</p>
<p class="verse">Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?</p>
<p class="verse">But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.</p>
<p class="verse">For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:</p>
<p class="verse">These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.</p>
<p class="verse">But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.</p>
<p class="verse">But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</p>
<p class="verse">But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the childrenâ€™s bread, and to cast it to dogs.</p>
<p class="verse">And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their mastersâ€™ table.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.</p>
<p class="verse">And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesusâ€™ feet; and he healed them:</p>
<p class="verse">Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.</p>
<p class="verse">And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.</p>
<p class="verse">And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</p>
<p class="verse">And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.</p>
<p class="verse">And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.</p>
<p class="verse">And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-matthew-16">
<h3>Chapter 16</h3>
<p class="verse">The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.</p>
<p class="verse">And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?</p>
<p class="verse">A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.</p>
<p class="verse">And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.</p>
<p class="verse">And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread.</p>
<p class="verse">Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?</p>
<p class="verse">Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?</p>
<p class="verse">Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?</p>
<p class="verse">How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?</p>
<p class="verse">Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.</p>
<p class="verse">When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?</p>
<p class="verse">And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse">He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?</p>
<p class="verse">And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse">But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</p>
<p class="verse">For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.</p>
<p class="verse">For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</p>
<p class="verse">For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.</p>
<p class="verse">Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-matthew-17">
<h3>Chapter 17</h3>
<p class="verse">And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,</p>
<p class="verse">And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.</p>
<p class="verse">While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only.</p>
<p class="verse">And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.</p>
<p class="verse">And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.</p>
<p class="verse">But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water.</p>
<p class="verse">And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.</p>
<p class="verse">Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.</p>
<p class="verse">And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?</p>
<p class="verse">He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?</p>
<p class="verse">Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free.</p>
<p class="verse">Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-matthew-18">
<h3>Chapter 18</h3>
<p class="verse">At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,</p>
<p class="verse">And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.</p>
<p class="verse">But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.</p>
<p class="verse">Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.</p>
<p class="verse">And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.</p>
<p class="verse">Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.</p>
<p class="verse">How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?</p>
<p class="verse">And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.</p>
<p class="verse">Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.</p>
<p class="verse">But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</p>
<p class="verse">And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.</p>
<p class="verse">Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</p>
<p class="verse">Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.</p>
<p class="verse">But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.</p>
<p class="verse">The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.</p>
<p class="verse">But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.</p>
<p class="verse">And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</p>
<p class="verse">And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.</p>
<p class="verse">So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.</p>
<p class="verse">Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:</p>
<p class="verse">Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?</p>
<p class="verse">And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.</p>
<p class="verse">So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.</p>

<h3>Chapter 19</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;</p>
<p class="verse">And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.</p>
<p class="verse">The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?</p>
<p class="verse">And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,</p>
<p class="verse">And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.</p>
<p class="verse">They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?</p>
<p class="verse">He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.</p>
<p class="verse">And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.</p>
<p class="verse">His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.</p>
<p class="verse">But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.</p>
<p class="verse">For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their motherâ€™s womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heavenâ€™s sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.</p>
<p class="verse">Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.</p>
<p class="verse">He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,</p>
<p class="verse">Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</p>
<p class="verse">The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.</p>
<p class="verse">But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse">When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?</p>
<p class="verse">But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.</p>
<p class="verse">Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my nameâ€™s sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.</p>
<p class="verse">But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-matthew-20">
<h3>Chapter 20</h3>
<p class="verse">For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</p>
<p class="verse">And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,</p>
<p class="verse">And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.</p>
<p class="verse">Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.</p>
<p class="verse">And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?</p>
<p class="verse">They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.</p>
<p class="verse">So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.</p>
<p class="verse">But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.</p>
<p class="verse">But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?</p>
<p class="verse">Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?</p>
<p class="verse">So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them,</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,</p>
<p class="verse">And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.</p>
<p class="verse">Then came to him the mother of Zebedeeâ€™s children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able.</p>
<p class="verse">And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them.</p>
<p class="verse">But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;</p>
<p class="verse">And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:</p>
<p class="verse">Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</p>
<p class="verse">And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.</p>
<p class="verse">And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you?</p>
<p class="verse">They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.</p>
<p class="verse">So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-matthew-21">
<h3>Chapter 21</h3>
<p class="verse">And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me.</p>
<p class="verse">And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.</p>
<p class="verse">All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.</p>
<p class="verse">And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,</p>
<p class="verse">And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon.</p>
<p class="verse">And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way.</p>
<p class="verse">And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?</p>
<p class="verse">And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,</p>
<p class="verse">And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.</p>
<p class="verse">And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased,</p>
<p class="verse">And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?</p>
<p class="verse">And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.</p>
<p class="verse">Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.</p>
<p class="verse">And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things.</p>
<p class="verse">The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?</p>
<p class="verse">But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.</p>
<p class="verse">And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</p>
<p class="verse">But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.</p>
<p class="verse">He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.</p>
<p class="verse">And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.</p>
<p class="verse">Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.</p>
<p class="verse">For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.</p>
<p class="verse">Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:</p>
<p class="verse">And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.</p>
<p class="verse">And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.</p>
<p class="verse">Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.</p>
<p class="verse">But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.</p>
<p class="verse">But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse">And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.</p>
<p class="verse">When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?</p>
<p class="verse">They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lordâ€™s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.</p>
<p class="verse">But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-matthew-22">
<h3>Chapter 22</h3>
<p class="verse">And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,</p>
<p class="verse">The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,</p>
<p class="verse">And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.</p>
<p class="verse">Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.</p>
<p class="verse">But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:</p>
<p class="verse">And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.</p>
<p class="verse">But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.</p>
<p class="verse">Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.</p>
<p class="verse">Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.</p>
<p class="verse">So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:</p>
<p class="verse">And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p class="verse">For many are called, but few are chosen.</p>
<p class="verse">Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.</p>
<p class="verse">And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.</p>
<p class="verse">Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?</p>
<p class="verse">But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?</p>
<p class="verse">Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.</p>
<p class="verse">And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?</p>
<p class="verse">They say unto him, Caesarâ€™s. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesarâ€™s; and unto God the things that are Godâ€™s.</p>
<p class="verse">When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.</p>
<p class="verse">The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</p>
<p class="verse">Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.</p>
<p class="verse">And last of all the woman died also.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.</p>
<p class="verse">For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse">But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.</p>
<p class="verse">Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Master, which is the great commandment in the law?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</p>
<p class="verse">This is the first and great commandment.</p>
<p class="verse">And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</p>
<p class="verse">On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse">While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of David.</p>
<p class="verse">He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?</p>
<p class="verse">If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?</p>
<p class="verse">And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-matthew-23">
<h3>Chapter 23</h3>
<p class="verse">Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Mosesâ€™ seat:</p>
<p class="verse">All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.</p>
<p class="verse">For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on menâ€™s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.</p>
<p class="verse">But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,</p>
<p class="verse">And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,</p>
<p class="verse">And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.</p>
<p class="verse">But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren.</p>
<p class="verse">And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.</p>
<p class="verse">And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.</p>
<p class="verse">But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.</p>
<p class="verse">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widowsâ€™ houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.</p>
<p class="verse">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.</p>
<p class="verse">Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!</p>
<p class="verse">Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?</p>
<p class="verse">And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?</p>
<p class="verse">Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.</p>
<p class="verse">And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein.</p>
<p class="verse">And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.</p>
<p class="verse">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.</p>
<p class="verse">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.</p>
<p class="verse">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead menâ€™s bones, and of all uncleanness.</p>
<p class="verse">Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,</p>
<p class="verse">And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse">Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city:</p>
<p class="verse">That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.</p>
<p class="verse">Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.</p>
<p class="verse">O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.</p>
<p class="verse">For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</p>

<h3>Chapter 24</h3>
<p class="verse">And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.</p>
<p class="verse">And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.</p>
<p class="verse">For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.</p>
<p class="verse">For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.</p>
<p class="verse">All these are the beginning of sorrows.</p>
<p class="verse">Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my nameâ€™s sake.</p>
<p class="verse">And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.</p>
<p class="verse">And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.</p>
<p class="verse">And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.</p>
<p class="verse">But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.</p>
<p class="verse">And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.</p>
<p class="verse">When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)</p>
<p class="verse">Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:</p>
<p class="verse">Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:</p>
<p class="verse">Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.</p>
<p class="verse">And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!</p>
<p class="verse">But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:</p>
<p class="verse">For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.</p>
<p class="verse">And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the electâ€™s sake those days shall be shortened.</p>
<p class="verse">Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not.</p>
<p class="verse">For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, I have told you before.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.</p>
<p class="verse">For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</p>
<p class="verse">For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.</p>
<p class="verse">Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:</p>
<p class="verse">And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</p>
<p class="verse">Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:</p>
<p class="verse">So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.</p>
<p class="verse">Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="verse">Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.</p>
<p class="verse">But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.</p>
<p class="verse">But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</p>
<p class="verse">For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,</p>
<p class="verse">And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</p>
<p class="verse">Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</p>
<p class="verse">Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</p>
<p class="verse">Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.</p>
<p class="verse">But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.</p>
<p class="verse">Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.</p>
<p class="verse">Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.</p>
<p class="verse">But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming;</p>
<p class="verse">And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;</p>
<p class="verse">The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,</p>
<p class="verse">And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>

<h3>Chapter 25</h3>
<p class="verse">Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</p>
<p class="verse">And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.</p>
<p class="verse">They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:</p>
<p class="verse">But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</p>
<p class="verse">While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</p>
<p class="verse">And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</p>
<p class="verse">And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.</p>
<p class="verse">But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</p>
<p class="verse">And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.</p>
<p class="verse">Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</p>
<p class="verse">But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.</p>
<p class="verse">Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</p>
<p class="verse">For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</p>
<p class="verse">And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.</p>
<p class="verse">Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.</p>
<p class="verse">And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.</p>
<p class="verse">But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lordâ€™s money.</p>
<p class="verse">After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.</p>
<p class="verse">And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.</p>
<p class="verse">His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</p>
<p class="verse">He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.</p>
<p class="verse">His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</p>
<p class="verse">Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:</p>
<p class="verse">And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.</p>
<p class="verse">His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:</p>
<p class="verse">Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.</p>
<p class="verse">Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.</p>
<p class="verse">For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.</p>
<p class="verse">And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p class="verse">When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</p>
<p class="verse">And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</p>
<p class="verse">Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</p>
<p class="verse">For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</p>
<p class="verse">Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</p>
<p class="verse">Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</p>
<p class="verse">When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</p>
<p class="verse">Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</p>
<p class="verse">And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</p>
<p class="verse">Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</p>
<p class="verse">For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:</p>
<p class="verse">I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</p>
<p class="verse">Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</p>
<p class="verse">Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.</p>
<p class="verse">And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-matthew-26">
<h3>Chapter 26</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,</p>
<p class="verse">Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</p>
<p class="verse">Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</p>
<p class="verse">And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him.</p>
<p class="verse">But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.</p>
<p class="verse">Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</p>
<p class="verse">There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.</p>
<p class="verse">But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?</p>
<p class="verse">For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</p>
<p class="verse">When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</p>
<p class="verse">For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.</p>
<p class="verse">For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.</p>
<p class="verse">Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</p>
<p class="verse">Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,</p>
<p class="verse">And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.</p>
<p class="verse">And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</p>
<p class="verse">And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</p>
<p class="verse">Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.</p>
<p class="verse">And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</p>
<p class="verse">And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?</p>
<p class="verse">And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</p>
<p class="verse">The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.</p>
<p class="verse">And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;</p>
<p class="verse">For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</p>
<p class="verse">But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Fatherâ€™s kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</p>
<p class="verse">Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</p>
<p class="verse">But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse">Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</p>
<p class="verse">Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</p>
<p class="verse">Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</p>
<p class="verse">Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</p>
<p class="verse">And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</p>
<p class="verse">And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</p>
<p class="verse">Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</p>
<p class="verse">He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</p>
<p class="verse">And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</p>
<p class="verse">And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</p>
<p class="verse">Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</p>
<p class="verse">Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</p>
<p class="verse">And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</p>
<p class="verse">Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</p>
<p class="verse">And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priestâ€™s, and smote off his ear.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</p>
<p class="verse">Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</p>
<p class="verse">But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</p>
<p class="verse">In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</p>
<p class="verse">But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</p>
<p class="verse">And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</p>
<p class="verse">But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priestâ€™s palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</p>
<p class="verse">But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</p>
<p class="verse">And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</p>
<p class="verse">And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</p>
<p class="verse">But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</p>
<p class="verse">What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</p>
<p class="verse">Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?</p>
<p class="verse">Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse">But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p class="verse">And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</p>
<p class="verse">And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</p>
<p class="verse">And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-matthew-27">
<h3>Chapter 27</h3>
<p class="verse">When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.</p>
<p class="verse">And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.</p>
<p class="verse">And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.</p>
<p class="verse">And they took counsel, and bought with them the potterâ€™s field, to bury strangers in.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse">Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;</p>
<p class="verse">And gave them for the potterâ€™s field, as the Lord appointed me.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?</p>
<p class="verse">And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.</p>
<p class="verse">Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.</p>
<p class="verse">And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?</p>
<p class="verse">For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.</p>
<p class="verse">When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.</p>
<p class="verse">But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.</p>
<p class="verse">Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.</p>
<p class="verse">And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.</p>
<p class="verse">When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.</p>
<p class="verse">Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.</p>
<p class="verse">Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.</p>
<p class="verse">And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</p>
<p class="verse">And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.</p>
<p class="verse">And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.</p>
<p class="verse">And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,</p>
<p class="verse">They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.</p>
<p class="verse">And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.</p>
<p class="verse">And sitting down they watched him there;</p>
<p class="verse">And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p class="verse">Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.</p>
<p class="verse">And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,</p>
<p class="verse">And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,</p>
<p class="verse">He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.</p>
<p class="verse">He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse">The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.</p>
<p class="verse">Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.</p>
<p class="verse">And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</p>
<p class="verse">Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.</p>
<p class="verse">And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</p>
<p class="verse">The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;</p>
<p class="verse">And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,</p>
<p class="verse">And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.</p>
<p class="verse">Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:</p>
<p class="verse">Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedeeâ€™s children.</p>
<p class="verse">When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesusâ€™ disciple:</p>
<p class="verse">He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</p>
<p class="verse">And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.</p>
<p class="verse">And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.</p>
<p class="verse">Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.</p>
<p class="verse">Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can.</p>
<p class="verse">So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.</p>

<h3>Chapter 28</h3>
<p class="verse">In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</p>
<p class="verse">His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</p>
<p class="verse">And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.</p>
<p class="verse">And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</p>
<p class="verse">He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</p>
<p class="verse">And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</p>
<p class="verse">And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.</p>
<p class="verse">And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</p>
<p class="verse">Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</p>
<p class="verse">And if this come to the governorâ€™s ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.</p>
<p class="verse">So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</p>
<p class="verse">Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</p>
<p class="verse">Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;</p>
<p class="verse">For the truthâ€™s sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</p>
<p class="verse">I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.</p>
<p class="verse">And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</p>
<p class="verse">And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.</p>
<p class="verse">For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.</p>
<p class="verse">Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.</p>
<p class="verse">Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.</p>
<p class="verse">If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:</p>
<p class="verse">For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.</p>
<p class="verse">Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.</p>
<p class="verse">The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</p>
<p class="verse">For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.</p>
<p class="verse">Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;</p>
<p class="verse">Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:</p>
<p class="verse">Because that for his nameâ€™s sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="verse">We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.</p>
<p class="verse">Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.</p>
<p class="verse">Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.</p>
<p class="verse">I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:</p>
<p class="verse">But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called:</p>
<p class="verse">Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.</p>
<p class="verse">Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.</p>
<p class="verse">For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.</p>
<p class="verse">And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.</p>
<p class="verse">Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.</p>
<p class="verse">But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.</p>
<p class="verse">Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.</p>
<p class="verse">These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;</p>
<p class="verse">Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,</p>
<p class="verse">To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.</p>
<p class="verse">These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having menâ€™s persons in admiration because of advantage.</p>
<p class="verse">But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;</p>
<p class="verse">How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.</p>
<p class="verse">These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse">But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,</p>
<p class="verse">Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse">And of some have compassion, making a difference:</p>
<p class="verse">And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.</p>
<p class="verse">Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,</p>
<p class="verse">To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.</p>
