<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of their names, every male by their polls;</p>
<p class="verse">From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel: thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies.</p>
<p class="verse">And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head of the house of his fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you: of the tribe of Reuben; Elizur the son of Shedeur.</p>
<p class="verse">Of Simeon; Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.</p>

<p class="verse">These were the renowned of the congregation, princes of the tribes of their fathers, heads of thousands in Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses and Aaron took these men which are expressed by their names:</p>
<p class="verse">And they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls.</p>
<p class="verse">As the LORD commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai.</p>
<p class="verse">And the children of Reuben, Israelâ€™s eldest son, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, by their polls, every male from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;</p>
<p class="verse">Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Reuben, were forty and six thousand and five hundred.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the children of Simeon, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, those that were numbered of them, according to the number of the names, by their polls, every male from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;</p>
<p class="verse">Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Simeon, were fifty and nine thousand and three hundred.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the children of Gad, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;</p>
<p class="verse">Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Gad, were forty and five thousand six hundred and fifty.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the children of Judah, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;</p>
<p class="verse">Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Judah, were threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the children of Issachar, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;</p>
<p class="verse">Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Issachar, were fifty and four thousand and four hundred.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the children of Zebulun, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;</p>
<p class="verse">Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Zebulun, were fifty and seven thousand and four hundred.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the children of Joseph, namely, of the children of Ephraim, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;</p>
<p class="verse">Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Ephraim, were forty thousand and five hundred.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the children of Manasseh, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;</p>
<p class="verse">Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Manasseh, were thirty and two thousand and two hundred.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the children of Benjamin, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;</p>
<p class="verse">Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Benjamin, were thirty and five thousand and four hundred.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the children of Dan, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;</p>
<p class="verse">Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Dan, were threescore and two thousand and seven hundred.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the children of Asher, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;</p>
<p class="verse">Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Asher, were forty and one thousand and five hundred.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the children of Naphtali, throughout their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;</p>
<p class="verse">Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Naphtali, were fifty and three thousand and four hundred.</p>
<p class="verse">These are those that were numbered, which Moses and Aaron numbered, and the princes of Israel, being twelve men: each one was for the house of his fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">So were all those that were numbered of the children of Israel, by the house of their fathers, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war in Israel;</p>
<p class="verse">Even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.</p>
<p class="verse">But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them.</p>
<p class="verse">For the LORD had spoken unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel:</p>
<p class="verse">But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse">And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts.</p>
<p class="verse">But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony.</p>
<p class="verse">And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">These also are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that the LORD spake with Moses in mount Sinai.</p>
<p class="verse">And these are the names of the sons of Aaron; Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.</p>
<p class="verse">These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priestâ€™s office.</p>
<p class="verse">And Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD, when they offered strange fire before the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children: and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priestâ€™s office in the sight of Aaron their father.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister unto him.</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do the service of the tabernacle.</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons: they are wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait on their priestâ€™s office: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of Israel: therefore the Levites shall be mine;</p>
<p class="verse">Because all the firstborn are mine; for on the day that I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast: mine shall they be: I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD, as he was commanded.</p>
<p class="verse">And these were the sons of Levi by their names; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari.</p>
<p class="verse">And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families; Libni, and Shimei.</p>
<p class="verse">And the sons of Kohath by their families; Amram, and Izehar, Hebron, and Uzziel.</p>
<p class="verse">And the sons of Merari by their families; Mahli, and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to the house of their fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites, and the family of the Shimites: these are the families of the Gershonites.</p>
<p class="verse">Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, even those that were numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred.</p>
<p class="verse">The families of the Gershonites shall pitch behind the tabernacle westward.</p>
<p class="verse">And the chief of the house of the father of the Gershonites shall be Eliasaph the son of Lael.</p>
<p class="verse">And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation shall be the tabernacle, and the tent, the covering thereof, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,</p>
<p class="verse">And the hangings of the court, and the curtain for the door of the court, which is by the tabernacle, and by the altar round about, and the cords of it for all the service thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">And of Kohath was the family of the Amramites, and the family of the Izeharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites: these are the families of the Kohathites.</p>
<p class="verse">In the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, were eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the sanctuary.</p>
<p class="verse">The families of the sons of Kohath shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle southward.</p>
<p class="verse">And the chief of the house of the father of the families of the Kohathites shall be Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.</p>
<p class="verse">And their charge shall be the ark, and the table, and the candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary wherewith they minister, and the hanging, and all the service thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be chief over the chief of the Levites, and have the oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary.</p>
<p class="verse">Of Merari was the family of the Mahlites, and the family of the Mushites: these are the families of Merari.</p>
<p class="verse">And those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, were six thousand and two hundred.</p>
<p class="verse">And the chief of the house of the father of the families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail: these shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle northward.</p>
<p class="verse">And under the custody and charge of the sons of Merari shall be the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the vessels thereof, and all that serveth thereto,</p>
<p class="verse">And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords.</p>
<p class="verse">But those that encamp before the tabernacle toward the east, even before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward, shall be Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel; and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse">All that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of the LORD, throughout their families, all the males from a month old and upward, were twenty and two thousand.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto Moses, Number all the firstborn of the males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am the LORD) instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses numbered, as the LORD commanded him, all the firstborn among the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel, which are more than the Levites;</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the poll, after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them: (the shekel is twenty gerahs:)</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of them is to be redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses took the redemption money of them that were over and above them that were redeemed by the Levites:</p>
<p class="verse">Of the firstborn of the children of Israel took he the money; a thousand three hundred and threescore and five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto Aaron and to his sons, according to the word of the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, after their families, by the house of their fathers,</p>
<p class="verse">From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse">This shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation, about the most holy things:</p>
<p class="verse">And when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall come, and his sons, and they shall take down the covering vail, and cover the ark of testimony with it:</p>
<p class="verse">And shall put thereon the covering of badgersâ€™ skins, and shall spread over it a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put in the staves thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and covers to cover withal: and the continual bread shall be thereon:</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover the same with a covering of badgersâ€™ skins, and shall put in the staves thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick of the light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his snuffdishes, and all the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they minister unto it:</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a covering of badgersâ€™ skins, and shall put it upon a bar.</p>
<p class="verse">And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue, and cover it with a covering of badgersâ€™ skins, and shall put to the staves thereof:</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall take all the instruments of ministry, wherewith they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of blue, and cover them with a covering of badgersâ€™ skins, and shall put them on a bar:</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth thereon:</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith they minister about it, even the censers, the fleshhooks, and the shovels, and the basons, all the vessels of the altar; and they shall spread upon it a covering of badgersâ€™ skins, and put to the staves of it.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it: but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die. These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse">And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest pertaineth the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the daily meat offering, and the anointing oil, and the oversight of all the tabernacle, and of all that therein is, in the sanctuary, and in the vessels thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites:</p>
<p class="verse">But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden:</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is defiled by the dead:</p>
<p class="verse">Both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell.</p>
<p class="verse">And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp: as the LORD spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the LORD, and that person be guilty;</p>
<p class="verse">Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed.</p>
<p class="verse">But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD, even to the priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for him.</p>
<p class="verse">And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.</p>
<p class="verse">And every manâ€™s hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man giveth the priest, it shall be his.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any manâ€™s wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,</p>
<p class="verse">And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her, neither she be taken with the manner;</p>
<p class="verse">And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled:</p>
<p class="verse">Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD:</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water:</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and uncover the womanâ€™s head, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, which is the jealousy offering: and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse:</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband, be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse:</p>
<p class="verse">But if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband:</p>
<p class="verse">Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell;</p>
<p class="verse">And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out with the bitter water:</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the womanâ€™s hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer it upon the altar:</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, even the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her people.</p>
<p class="verse">And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.</p>
<p class="verse">This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside to another instead of her husband, and is defiled;</p>
<p class="verse">Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.</p>
<p class="verse">Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall bear her iniquity.</p>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate themselves unto the LORD:</p>
<p class="verse">He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried.</p>
<p class="verse">All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk.</p>
<p class="verse">All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separateth himself unto the LORD, he shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.</p>
<p class="verse">All the days that he separateth himself unto the LORD he shall come at no dead body.</p>
<p class="verse">He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the consecration of his God is upon his head.</p>
<p class="verse">All the days of his separation he is holy unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.</p>
<p class="verse">And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, for that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering: but the days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was defiled.</p>
<p class="verse">And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall offer his offering unto the LORD, one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,</p>
<p class="verse">And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall bring them before the LORD, and shall offer his sin offering, and his burnt offering:</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also his meat offering, and his drink offering.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after the hair of his separation is shaven:</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD: this is holy for the priest, with the wave breast and heave shoulder: and after that the Nazarite may drink wine.</p>
<p class="verse">This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his offering unto the LORD for his separation, beside that that his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto them,</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.</p>

<p class="verse">And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold, unto the shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, was beaten work: according unto the pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses, so he made the candlestick.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p class="verse">And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and so make themselves clean.</p>
<p class="verse">Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, even fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offering.</p>

<p class="verse">And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service thereof, and shall serve no more:</p>
<p class="verse">But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge.</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season.</p>
<p class="verse">In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.</p>
<p class="verse">And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:</p>
<p class="verse">And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel?</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.</p>
<p class="verse">They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.</p>
<p class="verse">But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.</p>
<p class="verse">And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.</p>
<p class="verse">And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.</p>
<p class="verse">So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.</p>
<p class="verse">At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.</p>
<p class="verse">And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.</p>
<p class="verse">And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.</p>
<p class="verse">Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed.</p>
<p class="verse">At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-numbers-10">
<h3>Chapter 10</h3>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse">And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse">When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward.</p>
<p class="verse">When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.</p>
<p class="verse">But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.</p>
<p class="verse">And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations.</p>
<p class="verse">And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.</p>
<p class="verse">Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony.</p>
<p class="verse">And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.</p>
<p class="verse">And they first took their journey according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</p>
<p class="verse">In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according to their armies: and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.</p>
<p class="verse">And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethaneel the son of Zuar.</p>
<p class="verse">And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.</p>
<p class="verse">And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.</p>
<p class="verse">And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.</p>
<p class="verse">And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.</p>
<p class="verse">And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the other did set up the tabernacle against they came.</p>
<p class="verse">And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud.</p>
<p class="verse">And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.</p>
<p class="verse">And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.</p>
<p class="verse">And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward, which was the rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts: and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.</p>
<p class="verse">And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran.</p>
<p class="verse">And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies, when they set forward.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Mosesâ€™ father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the LORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good: for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And they departed from the mount of the LORD three daysâ€™ journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three daysâ€™ journey, to search out a resting place for them.</p>
<p class="verse">And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went out of the camp.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many thousands of Israel.</p>

<h3>Chapter 11</h3>
<p class="verse">And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.</p>
<p class="verse">And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the LORD, the fire was quenched.</p>
<p class="verse">And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the LORD burnt among them.</p>
<p class="verse">And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?</p>
<p class="verse">We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick:</p>
<p class="verse">But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes.</p>
<p class="verse">And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium.</p>
<p class="verse">And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?</p>
<p class="verse">Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?</p>
<p class="verse">Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.</p>
<p class="verse">I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.</p>
<p class="verse">And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.</p>
<p class="verse">And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;</p>
<p class="verse">But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.</p>
<p class="verse">Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORDâ€™s hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease.</p>
<p class="verse">But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.</p>
<p class="verse">And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.</p>
<p class="verse">And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the LORDâ€™s people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit upon them!</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a dayâ€™s journey on this side, and as it were a dayâ€™s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.</p>
<p class="verse">And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.</p>
<p class="verse">And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.</p>
<p class="verse">And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth.</p>

<h3>Chapter 12</h3>
<p class="verse">And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.</p>
<p class="verse">And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it.</p>
<p class="verse">(Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.)</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream.</p>
<p class="verse">My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.</p>
<p class="verse">With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?</p>
<p class="verse">And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed.</p>
<p class="verse">And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.</p>
<p class="verse">And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned.</p>
<p class="verse">Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his motherâ€™s womb.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again.</p>
<p class="verse">And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.</p>
<p class="verse">And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran.</p>

<h3>Chapter 13</h3>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.</p>
<p class="verse">These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain:</p>
<p class="verse">And see the land, what it is; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many;</p>
<p class="verse">And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds;</p>
<p class="verse">And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the firstripe grapes.</p>
<p class="verse">So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.</p>
<p class="verse">And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)</p>
<p class="verse">And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.</p>
<p class="verse">The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.</p>
<p class="verse">And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.</p>
<p class="verse">And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.</p>
<p class="verse">And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.</p>
<p class="verse">The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse">And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.</p>
<p class="verse">But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.</p>
<p class="verse">And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature.</p>
<p class="verse">And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.</p>

<h3>Chapter 14</h3>
<p class="verse">And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!</p>
<p class="verse">And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?</p>
<p class="verse">And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:</p>
<p class="verse">And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land.</p>
<p class="verse">If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.</p>
<p class="verse">Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.</p>
<p class="verse">But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them?</p>
<p class="verse">I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)</p>
<p class="verse">And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that thou LORD art among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.</p>
<p class="verse">Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse">And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my LORD be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation.</p>
<p class="verse">Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word:</p>
<p class="verse">But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;</p>
<p class="verse">Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:</p>
<p class="verse">But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.</p>
<p class="verse">(Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.</p>
<p class="verse">Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:</p>
<p class="verse">Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me,</p>
<p class="verse">Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.</p>
<p class="verse">But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.</p>
<p class="verse">But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse">And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse">After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.</p>
<p class="verse">I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.</p>
<p class="verse">And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land,</p>
<p class="verse">Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of the men that went to search the land, lived still.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.</p>
<p class="verse">And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.</p>
<p class="verse">Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies.</p>
<p class="verse">For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.</p>
<p class="verse">But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.</p>

<h3>Chapter 15</h3>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you,</p>
<p class="verse">And will make an offering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savour unto the LORD, of the herd, or of the flock:</p>
<p class="verse">Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil.</p>
<p class="verse">And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb.</p>
<p class="verse">Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil.</p>
<p class="verse">And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of wine, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the LORD:</p>
<p class="verse">Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid.</p>
<p class="verse">According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number.</p>
<p class="verse">All that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do.</p>
<p class="verse">One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever in your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you,</p>
<p class="verse">Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering: as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shall ye heave it.</p>
<p class="verse">Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave offering in your generations.</p>
<p class="verse">And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses,</p>
<p class="verse">Even all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations;</p>
<p class="verse">Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance:</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing all the people were in ignorance.</p>
<p class="verse">And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them.</p>
<p class="verse">But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</p>
<p class="verse">Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.</p>
<p class="verse">And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.</p>
<p class="verse">And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse">And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue:</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring:</p>
<p class="verse">That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.</p>
<p class="verse">I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.</p>

<h3>Chapter 16</h3>
<p class="verse">Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men:</p>
<p class="verse">And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:</p>
<p class="verse">And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?</p>
<p class="verse">And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:</p>
<p class="verse">And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will shew who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him.</p>
<p class="verse">This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;</p>
<p class="verse">And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow: and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose, he shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:</p>
<p class="verse">Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them?</p>
<p class="verse">And he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?</p>
<p class="verse">For which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the LORD: and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him?</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up:</p>
<p class="verse">Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:</p>
<p class="verse">And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each of you his censer.</p>
<p class="verse">And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.</p>
<p class="verse">And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.</p>
<p class="verse">And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.</p>
<p class="verse">So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind.</p>
<p class="verse">If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent me.</p>
<p class="verse">But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them:</p>
<p class="verse">And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.</p>
<p class="verse">They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse">And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.</p>
<p class="verse">And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.</p>
<p class="verse">The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar:</p>
<p class="verse">To be a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.</p>
<p class="verse">But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun.</p>
<p class="verse">And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.</p>
<p class="verse">And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.</p>
<p class="verse">Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah.</p>
<p class="verse">And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed.</p>

<h3>Chapter 17</h3>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every manâ€™s name upon his rod.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt write Aaronâ€™s name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass, that the manâ€™s rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathersâ€™ houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaronâ€™s rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.</p>
<p class="verse">And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish.</p>
<p class="verse">Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?</p>

<h3>Chapter 18</h3>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy fatherâ€™s house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.</p>
<p class="verse">And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness.</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priestâ€™s office for everything of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall serve: I have given your priestâ€™s office unto you as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.</p>
<p class="verse">In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat it: it shall be holy unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.</p>
<p class="verse">All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the LORD, them have I given thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring unto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thine house shall eat of it.</p>
<p class="verse">Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.</p>
<p class="verse">Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be thine: nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.</p>
<p class="verse">And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.</p>
<p class="verse">But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine.</p>
<p class="verse">All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse">Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.</p>
<p class="verse">But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse">But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe.</p>
<p class="verse">And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the winepress.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereof the LORDâ€™s heave offering to Aaron the priest.</p>
<p class="verse">Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die.</p>

<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke:</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:</p>
<p class="verse">And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times:</p>
<p class="verse">And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:</p>
<p class="verse">And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even.</p>
<p class="verse">And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.</p>
<p class="verse">And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin.</p>
<p class="verse">And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.</p>
<p class="verse">He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.</p>
<p class="verse">Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him.</p>
<p class="verse">This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.</p>
<p class="verse">And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean.</p>
<p class="verse">And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.</p>
<p class="verse">And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel:</p>
<p class="verse">And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave:</p>
<p class="verse">And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even.</p>
<p class="verse">But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even.</p>
<p class="verse">And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.</p>

<h3>Chapter 20</h3>
<p class="verse">Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.</p>
<p class="verse">And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.</p>
<p class="verse">And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!</p>
<p class="verse">And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?</p>
<p class="verse">And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.</p>
<p class="verse">This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:</p>
<p class="verse">How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:</p>
<p class="verse">And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border:</p>
<p class="verse">Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the kingâ€™s high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders.</p>
<p class="verse">And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword.</p>
<p class="verse">And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without doing anything else, go through on my feet.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.</p>
<p class="verse">And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.</p>
<p class="verse">Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor:</p>
<p class="verse">And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.</p>
<p class="verse">And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.</p>

<h3>Chapter 21</h3>
<p class="verse">And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners.</p>
<p class="verse">And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.</p>
<p class="verse">And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.</p>
<p class="verse">And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.</p>
<p class="verse">And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.</p>
<p class="verse">And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.</p>
<p class="verse">From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.</p>
<p class="verse">From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,</p>
<p class="verse">And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.</p>
<p class="verse">And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:</p>
<p class="verse">The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah:</p>
<p class="verse">And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:</p>
<p class="verse">And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.</p>
<p class="verse">And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but we will go along by the kingâ€™s high way, until we be past thy borders.</p>
<p class="verse">And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.</p>
<p class="verse">And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:</p>
<p class="verse">For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.</p>
<p class="verse">Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.</p>
<p class="verse">We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.</p>
<p class="verse">And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.</p>
<p class="verse">So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.</p>

<h3>Chapter 22</h3>
<p class="verse">And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.</p>
<p class="verse">And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.</p>
<p class="verse">He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:</p>
<p class="verse">Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.</p>
<p class="verse">And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.</p>
<p class="verse">And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?</p>
<p class="verse">And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.</p>
<p class="verse">And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.</p>
<p class="verse">And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.</p>
<p class="verse">And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.</p>
<p class="verse">And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.</p>
<p class="verse">And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:</p>
<p class="verse">For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.</p>
<p class="verse">And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more.</p>
<p class="verse">And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.</p>
<p class="verse">And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.</p>
<p class="verse">And Godâ€™s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.</p>
<p class="verse">And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.</p>
<p class="verse">But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaamâ€™s foot against the wall: and he smote her again.</p>
<p class="verse">And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaamâ€™s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?</p>
<p class="verse">And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.</p>
<p class="verse">And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me:</p>
<p class="verse">And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.</p>
<p class="verse">And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.</p>
<p class="verse">And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost coast.</p>
<p class="verse">And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?</p>
<p class="verse">And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.</p>
<p class="verse">And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.</p>
<p class="verse">And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost part of the people.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-numbers-23">
<h3>Chapter 23</h3>
<p class="verse">And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.</p>
<p class="verse">And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.</p>
<p class="verse">And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place.</p>
<p class="verse">And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD put a word in Balaamâ€™s mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.</p>
<p class="verse">And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, whom the LORD hath not defied?</p>
<p class="verse">For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.</p>
<p class="verse">Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!</p>
<p class="verse">And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.</p>
<p class="verse">And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD hath put in my mouth?</p>
<p class="verse">And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.</p>
<p class="verse">And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet the LORD yonder.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the LORD spoken?</p>
<p class="verse">And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:</p>
<p class="verse">God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it.</p>
<p class="verse">He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God is with him, and the shout of a king is among them.</p>
<p class="verse">God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn.</p>
<p class="verse">Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.</p>
<p class="verse">And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.</p>
<p class="verse">But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?</p>
<p class="verse">And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.</p>
<p class="verse">And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward Jeshimon.</p>
<p class="verse">And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.</p>
<p class="verse">And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-numbers-24">
<h3>Chapter 24</h3>
<p class="verse">And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse">And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:</p>
<p class="verse">He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:</p>
<p class="verse">How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!</p>
<p class="verse">As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the riverâ€™s side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters.</p>
<p class="verse">He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.</p>
<p class="verse">God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.</p>
<p class="verse">He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And Balakâ€™s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour.</p>
<p class="verse">And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD saith, that will I speak?</p>
<p class="verse">And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:</p>
<p class="verse">He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:</p>
<p class="verse">I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.</p>
<p class="verse">And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.</p>
<p class="verse">Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this!</p>
<p class="verse">And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way.</p>

<p class="verse">And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.</p>
<p class="verse">And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.</p>
<p class="verse">And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baalpeor.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand;</p>
<p class="verse">And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites.</p>
<p class="verse">And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house in Midian.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Vex the Midianites, and smite them:</p>
<p class="verse">For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the plague for Peorâ€™s sake.</p>

<p class="verse">Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.</p>
<p class="verse">And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons.</p>
<p class="verse">Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses brought their cause before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their fatherâ€™s brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter.</p>
<p class="verse">And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren.</p>
<p class="verse">And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his fatherâ€™s brethren.</p>
<p class="verse">And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered.</p>
<p class="verse">For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes: that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation,</p>
<p class="verse">Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him;</p>
<p class="verse">And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation:</p>

<p class="verse">If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse">If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a bond, being in her fatherâ€™s house in her youth;</p>
<p class="verse">And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.</p>
<p class="verse">But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.</p>
<p class="verse">And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;</p>
<p class="verse">And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.</p>
<p class="verse">But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it; then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the LORD shall forgive her.</p>
<p class="verse">But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.</p>
<p class="verse">And if she vowed in her husbandâ€™s house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath;</p>
<p class="verse">And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.</p>
<p class="verse">But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.</p>
<p class="verse">Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.</p>
<p class="verse">But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them.</p>
<p class="verse">But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse">These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, being yet in her youth in her fatherâ€™s house.</p>

<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian.</p>
<p class="verse">Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.</p>
<p class="verse">So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males.</p>
<p class="verse">And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.</p>
<p class="verse">And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods.</p>
<p class="verse">And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire.</p>
<p class="verse">And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts.</p>
<p class="verse">And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.</p>
<p class="verse">But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.</p>
<p class="verse">And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.</p>
<p class="verse">And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goatsâ€™ hair, and all things made of wood.</p>
<p class="verse">And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses;</p>
<p class="verse">Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,</p>
<p class="verse">Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation:</p>
<p class="verse">And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation:</p>
<p class="verse">And levy a tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:</p>
<p class="verse">Take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for an heave offering of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And of the children of Israelâ€™s half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse">And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,</p>
<p class="verse">And threescore and twelve thousand beeves,</p>
<p class="verse">And threescore and one thousand asses,</p>
<p class="verse">And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him.</p>
<p class="verse">And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep:</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORDâ€™s tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.</p>
<p class="verse">And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORDâ€™s tribute was threescore and twelve.</p>
<p class="verse">And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the LORDâ€™s tribute was threescore and one.</p>
<p class="verse">And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORDâ€™s tribute was thirty and two persons.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORDâ€™s heave offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse">And of the children of Israelâ€™s half, which Moses divided from the men that warred,</p>
<p class="verse">(Now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep,</p>
<p class="verse">And thirty and six thousand beeves,</p>
<p class="verse">And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,</p>
<p class="verse">And sixteen thousand persons;)</p>
<p class="verse">Even of the children of Israelâ€™s half, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse">And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses:</p>
<p class="verse">And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us.</p>
<p class="verse">We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.</p>
<p class="verse">(For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)</p>

<p class="verse">Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,</p>
<p class="verse">Even the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle:</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?</p>
<p class="verse">And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them?</p>
<p class="verse">Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land.</p>
<p class="verse">For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORDâ€™s anger was kindled the same time, and he sware, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:</p>
<p class="verse">Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORDâ€™s anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathersâ€™ stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.</p>
<p class="verse">And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:</p>
<p class="verse">But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.</p>
<p class="verse">We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse">For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the LORD to war,</p>
<p class="verse">And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,</p>
<p class="verse">And the land be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.</p>
<p class="verse">Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.</p>
<p class="verse">And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.</p>
<p class="verse">Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead:</p>
<p class="verse">But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my lord saith.</p>
<p class="verse">So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:</p>
<p class="verse">But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.</p>
<p class="verse">And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.</p>
<p class="verse">We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be ours.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities of the country round about.</p>
<p class="verse">And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,</p>
<p class="verse">And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,</p>
<p class="verse">And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.</p>
<p class="verse">And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,</p>
<p class="verse">And Nebo, and Baalmeon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they builded.</p>
<p class="verse">And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havothjair.</p>
<p class="verse">And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.</p>

<p class="verse">These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron.</p>

<p class="verse">And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians.</p>

<p class="verse">And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is in the edge of the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse">And they removed from Etham, and turned again unto Pihahiroth, which is before Baalzephon: and they pitched before Migdol.</p>

<p class="verse">And they removed from Eziongaber, and pitched in the wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh.</p>
<p class="verse">And they removed from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom.</p>
<p class="verse">And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the LORD, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the first day of the fifth month.</p>
<p class="verse">And Aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount Hor.</p>

<p class="verse">And they pitched by Jordan, from Bethjesimoth even unto Abelshittim in the plains of Moab.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;</p>
<p class="verse">Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places:</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every manâ€™s inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.</p>
<p class="verse">But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I thought to do unto them.</p>

<h3>Chapter 34</h3>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan; (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof:)</p>
<p class="verse">Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast of Edom, and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward:</p>
<p class="verse">And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadeshbarnea, and shall go on to Hazaraddar, and pass on to Azmon:</p>
<p class="verse">And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.</p>
<p class="verse">And as for the western border, ye shall even have the great sea for a border: this shall be your west border.</p>
<p class="verse">And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall point out for you mount Hor:</p>
<p class="verse">From mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad:</p>
<p class="verse">And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall be at Hazarenan: this shall be your north border.</p>

<p class="verse">And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which the LORD commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half tribe:</p>
<p class="verse">For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers, have received their inheritance; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance:</p>

<h3>Chapter 35</h3>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them.</p>
<p class="verse">And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts.</p>
<p class="verse">And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.</p>
<p class="verse">And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty and two cities.</p>
<p class="verse">So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs.</p>
<p class="verse">And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall give many; but from them that have few ye shall give few: every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan;</p>
<p class="verse">Then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares.</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment.</p>
<p class="verse">And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for refuge.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.</p>
<p class="verse">These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.</p>
<p class="verse">And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse">And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse">Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse">The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him.</p>
<p class="verse">But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die;</p>
<p class="verse">Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth him.</p>
<p class="verse">But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon him any thing without laying of wait,</p>
<p class="verse">Or with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm:</p>
<p class="verse">Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments:</p>
<p class="verse">And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil.</p>
<p class="verse">But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he was fled;</p>
<p class="verse">And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood:</p>
<p class="verse">Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.</p>
<p class="verse">So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.</p>
<p class="verse">Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.</p>
<p class="verse">So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.</p>
<p class="verse">Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.</p>

<h3>Chapter 36</h3>
<p class="verse">And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel:</p>
<p class="verse">And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.</p>
<p class="verse">And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.</p>
<p class="verse">This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry.</p>
<p class="verse">So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse">Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:</p>
<p class="verse">For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their fatherâ€™s brothersâ€™ sons:</p>
<p class="verse">And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.</p>
<p class="verse">These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;</p>
<p class="verse">To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;</p>
<p class="verse">To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;</p>
<p class="verse">To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.</p>
<p class="verse">A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:</p>
<p class="verse">To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</p>
<p class="verse">The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.</p>
<p class="verse">My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</p>
<p class="verse">For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</p>
<p class="verse">My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</p>
<p class="verse">If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:</p>
<p class="verse">Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:</p>
<p class="verse">We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:</p>
<p class="verse">Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:</p>
<p class="verse">My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:</p>
<p class="verse">For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</p>
<p class="verse">Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.</p>
<p class="verse">And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives.</p>
<p class="verse">So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:</p>
<p class="verse">She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse">Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;</p>
<p class="verse">But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:</p>
<p class="verse">I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;</p>
<p class="verse">When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.</p>
<p class="verse">Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:</p>
<p class="verse">For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:</p>
<p class="verse">They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</p>
<p class="verse">For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</p>
<p class="verse">But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.</p>

<p class="verse">Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.</p>

<p class="verse">For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.</p>
<p class="verse">Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?</p>
<p class="verse">Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?</p>

<p class="verse">Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.</p>

<p class="verse">Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?</p>
<p class="verse">Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike abomination to the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.</p>
<p class="verse">The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.</p>

<p class="verse">An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.</p>
<p class="verse">Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance is not good.</p>
<p class="verse">Manâ€™s goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way?</p>
<p class="verse">It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after vows to make enquiry.</p>
<p class="verse">A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.</p>

<p class="verse">Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts.</p>
<p class="verse">To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.</p>
<p class="verse">An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked, is sin.</p>
<p class="verse">The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but of every one that is hasty only to want.</p>
<p class="verse">The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.</p>
<p class="verse">The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment.</p>
<p class="verse">The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure, his work is right.</p>
<p class="verse">It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.</p>
<p class="verse">The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.</p>
<p class="verse">When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse">The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked: but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness.</p>
<p class="verse">Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.</p>

<p class="verse">It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse">The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.</p>
<p class="verse">He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.</p>
<p class="verse">The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.</p>
<p class="verse">It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman.</p>
<p class="verse">There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.</p>
<p class="verse">He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour.</p>
<p class="verse">A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.</p>
<p class="verse">Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud wrath.</p>
<p class="verse">The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour.</p>
<p class="verse">He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not.</p>
<p class="verse">The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind?</p>
<p class="verse">A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly.</p>
<p class="verse">A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the upright, he directeth his way.</p>

<p class="verse">A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished.</p>
<p class="verse">By humility and the fear of the LORD are riches, and honour, and life.</p>

<p class="verse">And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.</p>
<p class="verse">A wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength.</p>
<p class="verse">For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellors there is safety.</p>
<p class="verse">Wisdom is too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate.</p>
<p class="verse">He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.</p>
<p class="verse">The thought of foolishness is sin: and the scorner is an abomination to men.</p>

<p class="verse">If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be slain;</p>

<p class="verse">Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.</p>
<p class="verse">Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse">Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men:</p>
<p class="verse">For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.</p>
<p class="verse">Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.</p>
<p class="verse">Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a secret to another:</p>

<p class="verse">Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbourâ€™s house; lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee.</p>
<p class="verse">A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.</p>
<p class="verse">Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.</p>
<p class="verse">As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.</p>
<p class="verse">If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:</p>

<p class="verse">The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.</p>

<p class="verse">The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the field.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt have goatsâ€™ milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens.</p>

<h3>Chapter 28</h3>
<p class="verse">The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.</p>
<p class="verse">For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged.</p>
<p class="verse">A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.</p>
<p class="verse">They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.</p>
<p class="verse">Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all things.</p>
<p class="verse">Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.</p>
<p class="verse">Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father.</p>
<p class="verse">He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.</p>
<p class="verse">He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.</p>
<p class="verse">Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good things in possession.</p>
<p class="verse">The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.</p>
<p class="verse">When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.</p>
<p class="verse">He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.</p>
<p class="verse">Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.</p>
<p class="verse">As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over the poor people.</p>
<p class="verse">The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor: but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days.</p>
<p class="verse">A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him.</p>
<p class="verse">Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.</p>
<p class="verse">He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.</p>
<p class="verse">A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.</p>
<p class="verse">To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of bread that man will transgress.</p>
<p class="verse">He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.</p>
<p class="verse">He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.</p>
<p class="verse">Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer.</p>
<p class="verse">He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.</p>
<p class="verse">He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.</p>
<p class="verse">He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.</p>
<p class="verse">When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.</p>

<p class="verse">He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.</p>
<p class="verse">When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.</p>
<p class="verse">Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance.</p>
<p class="verse">The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it.</p>
<p class="verse">A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet.</p>
<p class="verse">In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice.</p>
<p class="verse">The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: but the wicked regardeth not to know it.</p>
<p class="verse">Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away wrath.</p>
<p class="verse">If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, there is no rest.</p>
<p class="verse">The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.</p>
<p class="verse">A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards.</p>
<p class="verse">If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked.</p>
<p class="verse">The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD lighteneth both their eyes.</p>
<p class="verse">The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame.</p>
<p class="verse">When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall.</p>
<p class="verse">Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul.</p>
<p class="verse">Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he.</p>
<p class="verse">A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer.</p>
<p class="verse">Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope of a fool than of him.</p>
<p class="verse">He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length.</p>
<p class="verse">An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression.</p>
<p class="verse">A manâ€™s pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.</p>
<p class="verse">Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not.</p>
<p class="verse">The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe.</p>
<p class="verse">Many seek the rulerâ€™s favour; but every manâ€™s judgment cometh from the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.</p>

<p class="verse">The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,</p>
<p class="verse">Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man.</p>
<p class="verse">I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.</p>
<p class="verse">Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his sonâ€™s name, if thou canst tell?</p>
<p class="verse">Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.</p>
<p class="verse">Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.</p>
<p class="verse">Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die:</p>
<p class="verse">Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:</p>
<p class="verse">Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.</p>
<p class="verse">Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.</p>
<p class="verse">There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.</p>
<p class="verse">There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness.</p>
<p class="verse">There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.</p>
<p class="verse">There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.</p>
<p class="verse">The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough:</p>
<p class="verse">The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.</p>
<p class="verse">The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.</p>
<p class="verse">There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:</p>
<p class="verse">The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.</p>
<p class="verse">Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.</p>
<p class="verse">For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear:</p>
<p class="verse">For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;</p>
<p class="verse">For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.</p>
<p class="verse">There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise:</p>
<p class="verse">The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;</p>
<p class="verse">The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;</p>
<p class="verse">The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;</p>
<p class="verse">The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kingsâ€™ palaces.</p>
<p class="verse">There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going:</p>
<p class="verse">A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;</p>
<p class="verse">A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up.</p>
<p class="verse">If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.</p>
<p class="verse">Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.</p>

<p class="verse">Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.</p>
<p class="verse">It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:</p>
<p class="verse">Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.</p>
<p class="verse">Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.</p>

<p class="verse">Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.</p>
<p class="verse">Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.</p>
<p class="verse">Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.</p>
<p class="verse">The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.</p>
<p class="verse">She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.</p>

<p class="verse">She is like the merchantsâ€™ ships; she bringeth her food from afar.</p>
<p class="verse">She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.</p>
<p class="verse">She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.</p>
<p class="verse">She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.</p>
<p class="verse">She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night.</p>
<p class="verse">She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.</p>
<p class="verse">She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.</p>
<p class="verse">She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.</p>
<p class="verse">She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple.</p>
<p class="verse">Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.</p>
<p class="verse">She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.</p>
<p class="verse">Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.</p>
<p class="verse">She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)</p>
<p class="verse">That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,</p>
<p class="verse">In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:</p>
<p class="verse">When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days.</p>
<p class="verse">And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the kingâ€™s palace;</p>
<p class="verse">Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.</p>
<p class="verse">And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king.</p>
<p class="verse">And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every manâ€™s pleasure.</p>
<p class="verse">Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.</p>
<p class="verse">On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,</p>
<p class="verse">To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.</p>
<p class="verse">But the queen Vashti refused to come at the kingâ€™s commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the kingâ€™s manner toward all that knew law and judgment:</p>
<p class="verse">And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the kingâ€™s face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)</p>
<p class="verse">What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?</p>
<p class="verse">And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.</p>
<p class="verse">For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the kingâ€™s princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.</p>
<p class="verse">If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the kingâ€™s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.</p>
<p class="verse">And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:</p>
<p class="verse">For he sent letters into all the kingâ€™s provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-esther-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said the kingâ€™s servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:</p>
<p class="verse">And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the kingâ€™s chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them:</p>
<p class="verse">And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.</p>
<p class="verse">Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;</p>
<p class="verse">Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.</p>
<p class="verse">And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncleâ€™s daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.</p>
<p class="verse">So it came to pass, when the kingâ€™s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the kingâ€™s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.</p>
<p class="verse">And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the kingâ€™s house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women.</p>
<p class="verse">Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it.</p>
<p class="verse">And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the womenâ€™s house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.</p>
<p class="verse">Now when every maidâ€™s turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)</p>
<p class="verse">Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the kingâ€™s house.</p>
<p class="verse">In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the kingâ€™s chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.</p>
<p class="verse">Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the kingâ€™s chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.</p>
<p class="verse">So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Estherâ€™s feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the kingâ€™s gate.</p>
<p class="verse">Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.</p>
<p class="verse">In those days, while Mordecai sat in the kingâ€™s gate, two of the kingâ€™s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.</p>
<p class="verse">And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecaiâ€™s name.</p>
<p class="verse">And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-esther-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the kingâ€™s servants, that were in the kingâ€™s gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the kingâ€™s servants, which were in the kingâ€™s gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the kingâ€™s commandment?</p>
<p class="verse">Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecaiâ€™s matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.</p>
<p class="verse">And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.</p>
<p class="verse">In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.</p>
<p class="verse">And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the kingâ€™s laws: therefore it is not for the kingâ€™s profit to suffer them.</p>
<p class="verse">If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the kingâ€™s treasuries.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jewsâ€™ enemy.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Then were the kingâ€™s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the kingâ€™s lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the kingâ€™s ring.</p>
<p class="verse">And the letters were sent by posts into all the kingâ€™s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.</p>
<p class="verse">The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day.</p>
<p class="verse">The posts went out, being hastened by the kingâ€™s commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-esther-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;</p>
<p class="verse">And came even before the kingâ€™s gate: for none might enter into the kingâ€™s gate clothed with sackcloth.</p>
<p class="verse">And in every province, whithersoever the kingâ€™s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.</p>
<p class="verse">So Estherâ€™s maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not.</p>
<p class="verse">Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the kingâ€™s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.</p>
<p class="verse">So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which was before the kingâ€™s gate.</p>
<p class="verse">And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the kingâ€™s treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.</p>
<p class="verse">Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people.</p>
<p class="verse">And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.</p>
<p class="verse">Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai;</p>
<p class="verse">All the kingâ€™s servants, and the people of the kingâ€™s provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.</p>
<p class="verse">And they told to Mordecai Estherâ€™s words.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the kingâ€™s house, more than all the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse">For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy fatherâ€™s house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?</p>
<p class="verse">Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,</p>
<p class="verse">Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.</p>
<p class="verse">So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-esther-5">
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the kingâ€™s house, over against the kingâ€™s house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse">And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.</p>
<p class="verse">Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is;</p>
<p class="verse">If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said.</p>
<p class="verse">Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the kingâ€™s gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.</p>
<p class="verse">And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.</p>
<p class="verse">Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the kingâ€™s gate.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-esther-6">
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse">On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the kingâ€™s chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the kingâ€™s servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the kingâ€™s house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.</p>
<p class="verse">And the kingâ€™s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.</p>
<p class="verse">So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself?</p>
<p class="verse">And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour,</p>
<p class="verse">Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head:</p>
<p class="verse">And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the kingâ€™s most noble princes, that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the kingâ€™s gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.</p>
<p class="verse">Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour.</p>
<p class="verse">And Mordecai came again to the kingâ€™s gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered.</p>
<p class="verse">And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.</p>
<p class="verse">And while they were yet talking with him, came the kingâ€™s chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-esther-7">
<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="verse">So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of the kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:</p>
<p class="verse">For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the kingâ€™s damage.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?</p>
<p class="verse">And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of the kingâ€™s mouth, they covered Hamanâ€™s face.</p>
<p class="verse">And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon.</p>
<p class="verse">So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the kingâ€™s wrath pacified.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-esther-8">
<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="verse">On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jewsâ€™ enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.</p>
<p class="verse">And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king,</p>
<p class="verse">And said, If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the kingâ€™s provinces:</p>
<p class="verse">For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse">Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the kingâ€™s name, and seal it with the kingâ€™s ring: for the writing which is written in the kingâ€™s name, and sealed with the kingâ€™s ring, may no man reverse.</p>
<p class="verse">Then were the kingâ€™s scribes called at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.</p>
<p class="verse">And he wrote in the king Ahasuerusâ€™ name, and sealed it with the kingâ€™s ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries:</p>
<p class="verse">Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,</p>
<p class="verse">Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.</p>
<p class="verse">The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.</p>
<p class="verse">So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the kingâ€™s commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace.</p>
<p class="verse">And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.</p>
<p class="verse">The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.</p>
<p class="verse">And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the kingâ€™s commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-esther-9">
<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
<p class="verse">Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the kingâ€™s commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)</p>
<p class="verse">The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.</p>
<p class="verse">For Mordecai was great in the kingâ€™s house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them.</p>
<p class="verse">And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.</p>
<p class="verse">And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,</p>
<p class="verse">And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,</p>
<p class="verse">And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,</p>
<p class="verse">The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.</p>
<p class="verse">On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the kingâ€™s provinces? now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be done.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this dayâ€™s decree, and let Hamanâ€™s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Hamanâ€™s ten sons.</p>
<p class="verse">For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.</p>
<p class="verse">But the other Jews that were in the kingâ€™s provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey,</p>
<p class="verse">On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.</p>
<p class="verse">But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.</p>
<p class="verse">And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far,</p>
<p class="verse">To stablish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,</p>
<p class="verse">As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them;</p>
<p class="verse">Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;</p>
<p class="verse">But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them,</p>
<p class="verse">The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their appointed time every year;</p>
<p class="verse">And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim.</p>
<p class="verse">And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,</p>
<p class="verse">To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry.</p>
<p class="verse">And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.</p>

<p class="verse">And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;</p>
<p class="verse">Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,</p>
<p class="verse">Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:</p>
<p class="verse">From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;</p>
<p class="verse">Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</p>
<p class="verse">But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;</p>
<p class="verse">Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</p>
<p class="verse">For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;</p>
<p class="verse">According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</p>
<p class="verse">And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;</p>
<p class="verse">Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</p>
<p class="verse">And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.</p>
<p class="verse">Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;</p>
<p class="verse">Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:</p>
<p class="verse">Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 timothy-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;</p>
<p class="verse">For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.</p>
<p class="verse">For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;</p>
<p class="verse">Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;</p>
<p class="verse">Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.</p>
<p class="verse">Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.</p>
<p class="verse">I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.</p>
<p class="verse">In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;</p>
<p class="verse">But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.</p>
<p class="verse">Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.</p>
<p class="verse">But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.</p>
<p class="verse">For Adam was first formed, then Eve.</p>
<p class="verse">And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.</p>
<p class="verse">Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 timothy-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.</p>
<p class="verse">A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;</p>
<p class="verse">Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;</p>
<p class="verse">One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;</p>
<p class="verse">(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)</p>
<p class="verse">Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;</p>
<p class="verse">Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</p>
<p class="verse">And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless.</p>
<p class="verse">Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.</p>
<p class="verse">Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.</p>
<p class="verse">For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:</p>
<p class="verse">But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 timothy-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;</p>
<p class="verse">Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;</p>
<p class="verse">Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:</p>
<p class="verse">For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</p>
<p class="verse">If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.</p>
<p class="verse">But refuse profane and old wivesâ€™ fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness.</p>
<p class="verse">For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</p>
<p class="verse">This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.</p>
<p class="verse">For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.</p>
<p class="verse">These things command and teach.</p>
<p class="verse">Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</p>
<p class="verse">Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse">Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.</p>
<p class="verse">Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.</p>
<p class="verse">Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.</p>

<p class="verse">Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;</p>

<p class="verse">But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.</p>
<p class="verse">Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.</p>
<p class="verse">But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.</p>
<p class="verse">And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.</p>
<p class="verse">But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.</p>
<p class="verse">Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man,</p>
<p class="verse">Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saintsâ€™ feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.</p>
<p class="verse">But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;</p>
<p class="verse">Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.</p>
<p class="verse">And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.</p>
<p class="verse">I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.</p>
<p class="verse">For some are already turned aside after Satan.</p>
<p class="verse">If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.</p>
<p class="verse">Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse">For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.</p>
<p class="verse">Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.</p>
<p class="verse">Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.</p>
<p class="verse">I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.</p>
<p class="verse">Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other menâ€™s sins: keep thyself pure.</p>
<p class="verse">Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomachâ€™s sake and thine often infirmities.</p>
<p class="verse">Some menâ€™s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 timothy-6">
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse">Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.</p>
<p class="verse">And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.</p>
<p class="verse">If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;</p>
<p class="verse">He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,</p>
<p class="verse">Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.</p>
<p class="verse">But godliness with contentment is great gain.</p>
<p class="verse">For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.</p>
<p class="verse">And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.</p>
<p class="verse">But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.</p>
<p class="verse">For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</p>
<p class="verse">But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.</p>
<p class="verse">Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.</p>
<p class="verse">I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;</p>
<p class="verse">That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse">Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;</p>
<p class="verse">Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;</p>
<p class="verse">That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;</p>
<p class="verse">Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse">O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:</p>
<p class="verse">Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,</p>
<p class="verse">To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;</p>
<p class="verse">Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</p>
<p class="verse">When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</p>
<p class="verse">For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</p>
<p class="verse">Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;</p>
<p class="verse">Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,</p>
<p class="verse">But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:</p>
<p class="verse">Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="verse">For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.</p>
<p class="verse">Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.</p>
<p class="verse">This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</p>
<p class="verse">The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:</p>
<p class="verse">But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me.</p>
<p class="verse">The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 timothy-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.</p>
<p class="verse">And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</p>
<p class="verse">The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.</p>
<p class="verse">Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</p>
<p class="verse">Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:</p>
<p class="verse">Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore I endure all things for the electâ€™s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</p>
<p class="verse">It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:</p>
<p class="verse">If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:</p>
<p class="verse">If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.</p>
<p class="verse">Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.</p>
<p class="verse">Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</p>
<p class="verse">But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.</p>
<p class="verse">And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</p>
<p class="verse">Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse">But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.</p>
<p class="verse">If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the masterâ€™s use, and prepared unto every good work.</p>
<p class="verse">Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p>
<p class="verse">But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.</p>
<p class="verse">And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,</p>
<p class="verse">In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;</p>
<p class="verse">And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 timothy-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</p>
<p class="verse">For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</p>
<p class="verse">Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</p>
<p class="verse">Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</p>
<p class="verse">Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</p>
<p class="verse">For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,</p>
<p class="verse">Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.</p>
<p class="verse">But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.</p>
<p class="verse">But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,</p>
<p class="verse">Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</p>
<p class="verse">But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</p>
<p class="verse">But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;</p>
<p class="verse">And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</p>
<p class="verse">That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 timothy-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;</p>
<p class="verse">Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse">For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.</p>
<p class="verse">But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.</p>
<p class="verse">For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</p>
<p class="verse">I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:</p>
<p class="verse">Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.</p>
<p class="verse">Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:</p>
<p class="verse">For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.</p>
<p class="verse">Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</p>
<p class="verse">And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.</p>
<p class="verse">The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.</p>
<p class="verse">Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:</p>
<p class="verse">Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.</p>
<p class="verse">At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.</p>
<p class="verse">Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.</p>
<p class="verse">Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.</p>
<p class="verse">Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</p>
<p class="verse">The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of Godâ€™s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</p>
<p class="verse">In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;</p>
<p class="verse">But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</p>
<p class="verse">To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</p>
<p class="verse">For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</p>
<p class="verse">If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.</p>
<p class="verse">For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;</p>
<p class="verse">But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;</p>
<p class="verse">Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</p>
<p class="verse">For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:</p>
<p class="verse">Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucreâ€™s sake.</p>
<p class="verse">One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.</p>
<p class="verse">This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</p>
<p class="verse">Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.</p>
<p class="verse">They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-titus-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:</p>
<p class="verse">That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.</p>
<p class="verse">The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;</p>
<p class="verse">That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,</p>
<p class="verse">To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</p>
<p class="verse">Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.</p>
<p class="verse">In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,</p>
<p class="verse">Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.</p>
<p class="verse">Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;</p>
<p class="verse">Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</p>
<p class="verse">For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,</p>
<p class="verse">Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;</p>
<p class="verse">Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</p>
<p class="verse">Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</p>
<p class="verse">These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-titus-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,</p>
<p class="verse">To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.</p>
<p class="verse">For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</p>
<p class="verse">But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,</p>
<p class="verse">Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</p>
<p class="verse">Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</p>
<p class="verse">That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse">This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</p>
<p class="verse">But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</p>
<p class="verse">A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;</p>
<p class="verse">Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.</p>
<p class="verse">When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.</p>
<p class="verse">Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</p>
<p class="verse">All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.</p>
