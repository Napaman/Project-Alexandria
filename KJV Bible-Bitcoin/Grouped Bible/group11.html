<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</p>
<p class="verse">The same was in the beginning with God.</p>
<p class="verse">All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</p>
<p class="verse">In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</p>
<p class="verse">And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.</p>
<p class="verse">There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</p>
<p class="verse">The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.</p>
<p class="verse">He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.</p>
<p class="verse">That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</p>
<p class="verse">He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</p>
<p class="verse">He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</p>
<p class="verse">But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:</p>
<p class="verse">Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</p>
<p class="verse">John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.</p>
<p class="verse">And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.</p>
<p class="verse">For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.</p>
<p class="verse">And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?</p>
<p class="verse">And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</p>
<p class="verse">He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.</p>
<p class="verse">And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.</p>
<p class="verse">And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?</p>
<p class="verse">John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;</p>
<p class="verse">He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.</p>
<p class="verse">These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</p>
<p class="verse">The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.</p>
<p class="verse">This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.</p>
<p class="verse">And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</p>
<p class="verse">And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.</p>
<p class="verse">And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse">And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;</p>
<p class="verse">And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!</p>
<p class="verse">And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?</p>
<p class="verse">He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.</p>
<p class="verse">One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.</p>
<p class="verse">He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.</p>
<p class="verse">The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.</p>
<p class="verse">Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</p>
<p class="verse">Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</p>
<p class="verse">And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!</p>
<p class="verse">Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.</p>
<p class="verse">And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-john-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</p>
<p class="verse">And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.</p>
<p class="verse">His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.</p>
<p class="verse">And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</p>
<p class="verse">And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.</p>
<p class="verse">When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,</p>
<p class="verse">And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.</p>
<p class="verse">This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</p>
<p class="verse">After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,</p>
<p class="verse">And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the tables;</p>
<p class="verse">And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise.</p>
<p class="verse">And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.</p>
<p class="verse">Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?</p>
<p class="verse">But he spake of the temple of his body.</p>
<p class="verse">When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</p>
<p class="verse">Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,</p>
<p class="verse">And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-john-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</p>
<p class="verse">The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse">That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</p>
<p class="verse">Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.</p>
<p class="verse">The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse">Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?</p>
<p class="verse">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.</p>
<p class="verse">If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?</p>
<p class="verse">And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</p>
<p class="verse">That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</p>
<p class="verse">For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</p>
<p class="verse">He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</p>
<p class="verse">For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</p>
<p class="verse">But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</p>
<p class="verse">After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</p>
<p class="verse">And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</p>
<p class="verse">For John was not yet cast into prison.</p>
<p class="verse">Then there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.</p>
<p class="verse">And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.</p>
<p class="verse">John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.</p>
<p class="verse">He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</p>
<p class="verse">He must increase, but I must decrease.</p>
<p class="verse">He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.</p>
<p class="verse">And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.</p>
<p class="verse">He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.</p>
<p class="verse">For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.</p>
<p class="verse">The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</p>
<p class="verse">He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-john-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,</p>
<p class="verse">(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)</p>
<p class="verse">He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse">And he must needs go through Samaria.</p>
<p class="verse">Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</p>
<p class="verse">Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.</p>
<p class="verse">There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.</p>
<p class="verse">(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)</p>
<p class="verse">Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</p>
<p class="verse">The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?</p>
<p class="verse">Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</p>
<p class="verse">But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</p>
<p class="verse">The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</p>
<p class="verse">The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:</p>
<p class="verse">For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.</p>
<p class="verse">The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</p>
<p class="verse">Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse">But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</p>
<p class="verse">God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.</p>
<p class="verse">The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.</p>
<p class="verse">And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?</p>
<p class="verse">The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,</p>
<p class="verse">Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?</p>
<p class="verse">Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</p>
<p class="verse">In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.</p>
<p class="verse">But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</p>
<p class="verse">Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</p>
<p class="verse">And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</p>
<p class="verse">And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</p>
<p class="verse">I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.</p>
<p class="verse">And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.</p>
<p class="verse">So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.</p>
<p class="verse">And many more believed because of his own word;</p>
<p class="verse">And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</p>
<p class="verse">Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse">For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.</p>
<p class="verse">Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</p>
<p class="verse">So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</p>
<p class="verse">When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</p>
<p class="verse">The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.</p>
<p class="verse">And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.</p>
<p class="verse">Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</p>
<p class="verse">So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.</p>
<p class="verse">This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-john-5">
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</p>
<p class="verse">In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</p>
<p class="verse">For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.</p>
<p class="verse">And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</p>
<p class="verse">When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?</p>
<p class="verse">The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</p>
<p class="verse">And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</p>
<p class="verse">The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.</p>
<p class="verse">He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</p>
<p class="verse">Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?</p>
<p class="verse">And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.</p>
<p class="verse">Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse">The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.</p>
<p class="verse">And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</p>
<p class="verse">Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</p>
<p class="verse">For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.</p>
<p class="verse">For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.</p>
<p class="verse">For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:</p>
<p class="verse">That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.</p>
<p class="verse">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.</p>
<p class="verse">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</p>
<p class="verse">For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;</p>
<p class="verse">And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.</p>
<p class="verse">Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</p>
<p class="verse">And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.</p>
<p class="verse">I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.</p>
<p class="verse">If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</p>
<p class="verse">There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.</p>
<p class="verse">He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</p>
<p class="verse">But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.</p>
<p class="verse">Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</p>
<p class="verse">I receive not honour from men.</p>
<p class="verse">But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</p>
<p class="verse">I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.</p>
<p class="verse">How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?</p>
<p class="verse">Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.</p>
<p class="verse">For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.</p>
<p class="verse">But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?</p>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse">After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.</p>
<p class="verse">And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.</p>
<p class="verse">And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.</p>
<p class="verse">When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?</p>
<p class="verse">And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.</p>
<p class="verse">Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.</p>
<p class="verse">One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, saith unto him,</p>
<p class="verse">There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.</p>
<p class="verse">When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.</p>
<p class="verse">Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.</p>
<p class="verse">When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.</p>
<p class="verse">And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,</p>
<p class="verse">And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.</p>
<p class="verse">And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.</p>
<p class="verse">So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.</p>
<p class="verse">But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.</p>
<p class="verse">Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.</p>
<p class="verse">The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;</p>
<p class="verse">(Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)</p>
<p class="verse">When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.</p>
<p class="verse">Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.</p>
<p class="verse">They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?</p>
<p class="verse">Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.</p>
<p class="verse">But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.</p>
<p class="verse">All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.</p>
<p class="verse">For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.</p>
<p class="verse">And this is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.</p>
<p class="verse">And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.</p>
<p class="verse">The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.</p>
<p class="verse">No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.</p>
<p class="verse">It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</p>
<p class="verse">Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.</p>
<p class="verse">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.</p>
<p class="verse">I am that bread of life.</p>
<p class="verse">Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.</p>
<p class="verse">This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.</p>
<p class="verse">I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</p>
<p class="verse">The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?</p>
<p class="verse">Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.</p>
<p class="verse">Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.</p>
<p class="verse">For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</p>
<p class="verse">He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</p>
<p class="verse">As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.</p>
<p class="verse">This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.</p>
<p class="verse">Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?</p>
<p class="verse">When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?</p>
<p class="verse">What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?</p>
<p class="verse">It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.</p>
<p class="verse">But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.</p>
<p class="verse">From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?</p>
<p class="verse">Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse">And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?</p>
<p class="verse">He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-john-7">
<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="verse">After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the Jews’ feast of tabernacles was at hand.</p>
<p class="verse">His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.</p>
<p class="verse">For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.</p>
<p class="verse">For neither did his brethren believe in him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.</p>
<p class="verse">The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.</p>
<p class="verse">Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my time is not yet full come.</p>
<p class="verse">When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse">But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</p>
<p class="verse">And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse">Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</p>
<p class="verse">If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</p>
<p class="verse">He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</p>
<p class="verse">Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?</p>
<p class="verse">The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.</p>
<p class="verse">Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.</p>
<p class="verse">If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?</p>
<p class="verse">Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?</p>
<p class="verse">But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</p>
<p class="verse">Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</p>
<p class="verse">But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.</p>
<p class="verse">Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</p>
<p class="verse">And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?</p>
<p class="verse">The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</p>
<p class="verse">What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?</p>
<p class="verse">In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</p>
<p class="verse">He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</p>
<p class="verse">(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</p>
<p class="verse">Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.</p>
<p class="verse">Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?</p>
<p class="verse">Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</p>
<p class="verse">So there was a division among the people because of him.</p>
<p class="verse">And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?</p>
<p class="verse">The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.</p>
<p class="verse">Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?</p>
<p class="verse">Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?</p>
<p class="verse">But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.</p>
<p class="verse">Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)</p>
<p class="verse">Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?</p>
<p class="verse">They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.</p>
<p class="verse">And every man went unto his own house.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-john-8">
<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="verse">Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.</p>
<p class="verse">And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.</p>
<p class="verse">And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,</p>
<p class="verse">They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</p>
<p class="verse">Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?</p>
<p class="verse">This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.</p>
<p class="verse">So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</p>
<p class="verse">And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</p>
<p class="verse">And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</p>
<p class="verse">When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</p>
<p class="verse">She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</p>
<p class="verse">Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</p>
<p class="verse">The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.</p>
<p class="verse">And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</p>
<p class="verse">It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.</p>
<p class="verse">I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.</p>
<p class="verse">These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</p>
<p class="verse">I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.</p>
<p class="verse">I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.</p>
<p class="verse">They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</p>
<p class="verse">And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.</p>
<p class="verse">As he spake these words, many believed on him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</p>
<p class="verse">They answered him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.</p>
<p class="verse">And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.</p>
<p class="verse">If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</p>
<p class="verse">I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</p>
<p class="verse">I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</p>
<p class="verse">They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</p>
<p class="verse">But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</p>
<p class="verse">Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</p>
<p class="verse">And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.</p>
<p class="verse">Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?</p>
<p class="verse">He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.</p>
<p class="verse">And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</p>
<p class="verse">Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.</p>
<p class="verse">Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:</p>
<p class="verse">Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.</p>
<p class="verse">Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</p>
<p class="verse">Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-john-9">
<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
<p class="verse">And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.</p>
<p class="verse">And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</p>
<p class="verse">I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</p>
<p class="verse">As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</p>
<p class="verse">When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,</p>
<p class="verse">And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</p>
<p class="verse">The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</p>
<p class="verse">Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?</p>
<p class="verse">He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.</p>
<p class="verse">They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</p>
<p class="verse">Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</p>
<p class="verse">They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.</p>
<p class="verse">But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.</p>
<p class="verse">And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?</p>
<p class="verse">His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</p>
<p class="verse">But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.</p>
<p class="verse">These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.</p>
<p class="verse">He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?</p>
<p class="verse">He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?</p>
<p class="verse">Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses’ disciples.</p>
<p class="verse">We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.</p>
<p class="verse">The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.</p>
<p class="verse">Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.</p>
<p class="verse">Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.</p>
<p class="verse">If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.</p>
<p class="verse">They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</p>
<p class="verse">He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.</p>
<p class="verse">And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.</p>

<h3>Chapter 10</h3>
<p class="verse">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.</p>
<p class="verse">But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse">To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.</p>
<p class="verse">And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.</p>
<p class="verse">This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse">All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.</p>
<p class="verse">I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.</p>
<p class="verse">The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</p>
<p class="verse">I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse">But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse">The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse">I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.</p>
<p class="verse">As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse">And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.</p>
<p class="verse">No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.</p>
<p class="verse">There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.</p>
<p class="verse">And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?</p>
<p class="verse">Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</p>
<p class="verse">And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch.</p>
<p class="verse">Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father’s name, they bear witness of me.</p>
<p class="verse">But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:</p>
<p class="verse">And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.</p>
<p class="verse">My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father’s hand.</p>
<p class="verse">I and my Father are one.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?</p>
<p class="verse">The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?</p>
<p class="verse">If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;</p>
<p class="verse">Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?</p>
<p class="verse">If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</p>
<p class="verse">But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,</p>
<p class="verse">And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.</p>
<p class="verse">And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.</p>
<p class="verse">And many believed on him there.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-john-11">
<h3>Chapter 11</h3>
<p class="verse">Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.</p>
<p class="verse">(It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.</p>
<p class="verse">When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.</p>
<p class="verse">Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</p>
<p class="verse">When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.</p>
<p class="verse">Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.</p>
<p class="verse">His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.</p>
<p class="verse">But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.</p>
<p class="verse">These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.</p>
<p class="verse">And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.</p>
<p class="verse">Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:</p>
<p class="verse">And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</p>
<p class="verse">But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.</p>
<p class="verse">Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:</p>
<p class="verse">And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?</p>
<p class="verse">She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.</p>
<p class="verse">And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.</p>
<p class="verse">As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.</p>
<p class="verse">Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.</p>
<p class="verse">The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.</p>
<p class="verse">Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</p>
<p class="verse">When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,</p>
<p class="verse">And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus wept.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!</p>
<p class="verse">And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?</p>
<p class="verse">Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.</p>
<p class="verse">And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</p>
<p class="verse">And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.</p>
<p class="verse">Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.</p>
<p class="verse">But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.</p>
<p class="verse">Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.</p>
<p class="verse">If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.</p>
<p class="verse">And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,</p>
<p class="verse">Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</p>
<p class="verse">And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;</p>
<p class="verse">And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.</p>
<p class="verse">Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Jews’ passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.</p>
<p class="verse">Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?</p>
<p class="verse">Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-john-12">
<h3>Chapter 12</h3>
<p class="verse">Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</p>
<p class="verse">There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</p>
<p class="verse">Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, which should betray him,</p>
<p class="verse">Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</p>
<p class="verse">This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.</p>
<p class="verse">For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.</p>
<p class="verse">Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</p>
<p class="verse">But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;</p>
<p class="verse">Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</p>
<p class="verse">Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,</p>
<p class="verse">Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt.</p>
<p class="verse">These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.</p>
<p class="verse">The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.</p>
<p class="verse">For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.</p>
<p class="verse">The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.</p>
<p class="verse">And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:</p>
<p class="verse">The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</p>
<p class="verse">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</p>
<p class="verse">He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.</p>
<p class="verse">If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.</p>
<p class="verse">Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.</p>
<p class="verse">Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</p>
<p class="verse">The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</p>
<p class="verse">Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</p>
<p class="verse">And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</p>
<p class="verse">This he said, signifying what death he should die.</p>
<p class="verse">The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?</p>
<p class="verse">Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</p>
<p class="verse">While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.</p>
<p class="verse">But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:</p>
<p class="verse">That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,</p>
<p class="verse">He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</p>
<p class="verse">These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</p>
<p class="verse">For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</p>
<p class="verse">And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.</p>
<p class="verse">I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.</p>
<p class="verse">And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</p>
<p class="verse">He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</p>
<p class="verse">For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</p>
<p class="verse">And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-john-13">
<h3>Chapter 13</h3>
<p class="verse">Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.</p>
<p class="verse">And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray him;</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;</p>
<p class="verse">He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.</p>
<p class="verse">After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.</p>
<p class="verse">Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.</p>
<p class="verse">Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.</p>
<p class="verse">Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.</p>
<p class="verse">For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.</p>
<p class="verse">So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?</p>
<p class="verse">Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.</p>
<p class="verse">If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another’s feet.</p>
<p class="verse">For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.</p>
<p class="verse">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.</p>
<p class="verse">If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.</p>
<p class="verse">I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.</p>
<p class="verse">Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he.</p>
<p class="verse">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.</p>
<p class="verse">When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.</p>
<p class="verse">Now there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.</p>
<p class="verse">Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.</p>
<p class="verse">He then lying on Jesus’ breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</p>
<p class="verse">And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.</p>
<p class="verse">Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.</p>
<p class="verse">For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.</p>
<p class="verse">He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</p>
<p class="verse">If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.</p>
<p class="verse">Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you.</p>
<p class="verse">A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</p>
<p class="verse">By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</p>
<p class="verse">Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.</p>
<p class="verse">Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.</p>

<h3>Chapter 14</h3>
<p class="verse">Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.</p>
<p class="verse">In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.</p>
<p class="verse">And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.</p>
<p class="verse">And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.</p>
<p class="verse">Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.</p>
<p class="verse">If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.</p>
<p class="verse">Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?</p>
<p class="verse">Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.</p>
<p class="verse">Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works’ sake.</p>
<p class="verse">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.</p>
<p class="verse">And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</p>
<p class="verse">If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.</p>
<p class="verse">If ye love me, keep my commandments.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;</p>
<p class="verse">Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.</p>
<p class="verse">I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.</p>
<p class="verse">At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.</p>
<p class="verse">He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.</p>
<p class="verse">Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</p>
<p class="verse">He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father’s which sent me.</p>
<p class="verse">These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.</p>
<p class="verse">But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.</p>
<p class="verse">And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.</p>
<p class="verse">Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.</p>
<p class="verse">But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.</p>

<h3>Chapter 15</h3>
<p class="verse">I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.</p>
<p class="verse">Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.</p>
<p class="verse">Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</p>
<p class="verse">I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.</p>
<p class="verse">If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.</p>
<p class="verse">If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.</p>
<p class="verse">As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.</p>
<p class="verse">If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love.</p>
<p class="verse">These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.</p>
<p class="verse">This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.</p>
<p class="verse">Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.</p>
<p class="verse">Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.</p>
<p class="verse">These things I command you, that ye love one another.</p>
<p class="verse">If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.</p>
<p class="verse">If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</p>
<p class="verse">Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.</p>
<p class="verse">But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me.</p>
<p class="verse">If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin.</p>
<p class="verse">He that hateth me hateth my Father also.</p>
<p class="verse">If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.</p>
<p class="verse">But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.</p>
<p class="verse">But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:</p>
<p class="verse">And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-john-16">
<h3>Chapter 16</h3>
<p class="verse">These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.</p>
<p class="verse">They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.</p>
<p class="verse">And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.</p>
<p class="verse">But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.</p>
<p class="verse">But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?</p>
<p class="verse">But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:</p>
<p class="verse">Of sin, because they believe not on me;</p>
<p class="verse">Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;</p>
<p class="verse">Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.</p>
<p class="verse">I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.</p>
<p class="verse">He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?</p>
<p class="verse">They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.</p>
<p class="verse">Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?</p>
<p class="verse">Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.</p>
<p class="verse">A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.</p>
<p class="verse">And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.</p>
<p class="verse">Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.</p>
<p class="verse">These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.</p>
<p class="verse">At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:</p>
<p class="verse">For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.</p>
<p class="verse">I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.</p>
<p class="verse">His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.</p>
<p class="verse">Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</p>
<p class="verse">These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-john-17">
<h3>Chapter 17</h3>
<p class="verse">These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:</p>
<p class="verse">As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.</p>
<p class="verse">And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</p>
<p class="verse">I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.</p>
<p class="verse">And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</p>
<p class="verse">I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.</p>
<p class="verse">Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.</p>
<p class="verse">For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.</p>
<p class="verse">I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.</p>
<p class="verse">And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.</p>
<p class="verse">And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.</p>
<p class="verse">While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="verse">And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.</p>
<p class="verse">I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</p>
<p class="verse">I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.</p>
<p class="verse">They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</p>
<p class="verse">Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.</p>
<p class="verse">As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.</p>
<p class="verse">And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;</p>
<p class="verse">That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.</p>
<p class="verse">And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:</p>
<p class="verse">I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.</p>
<p class="verse">Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.</p>
<p class="verse">O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.</p>
<p class="verse">And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.</p>

<h3>Chapter 18</h3>
<p class="verse">When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.</p>
<p class="verse">And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.</p>
<p class="verse">Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?</p>
<p class="verse">They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.</p>
<p class="verse">As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.</p>
<p class="verse">Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:</p>
<p class="verse">That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?</p>
<p class="verse">Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,</p>
<p class="verse">And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.</p>
<p class="verse">Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.</p>
<p class="verse">And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.</p>
<p class="verse">But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.</p>
<p class="verse">Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man’s disciples? He saith, I am not.</p>
<p class="verse">And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.</p>
<p class="verse">The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.</p>
<p class="verse">Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?</p>
<p class="verse">Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.</p>
<p class="verse">And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.</p>
<p class="verse">One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?</p>
<p class="verse">Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.</p>
<p class="verse">Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.</p>
<p class="verse">Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?</p>
<p class="verse">They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:</p>
<p class="verse">That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?</p>
<p class="verse">Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.</p>
<p class="verse">Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.</p>
<p class="verse">Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all.</p>
<p class="verse">But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</p>
<p class="verse">Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-john-19">
<h3>Chapter 19</h3>
<p class="verse">Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.</p>
<p class="verse">And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,</p>
<p class="verse">And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.</p>
<p class="verse">Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!</p>
<p class="verse">When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.</p>
<p class="verse">The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse">When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;</p>
<p class="verse">And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.</p>
<p class="verse">Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.</p>
<p class="verse">And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar’s friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.</p>
<p class="verse">When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!</p>
<p class="verse">But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.</p>
<p class="verse">Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.</p>
<p class="verse">And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:</p>
<p class="verse">Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.</p>
<p class="verse">And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p class="verse">This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse">Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</p>
<p class="verse">They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.</p>
<p class="verse">Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.</p>
<p class="verse">When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!</p>
<p class="verse">Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.</p>
<p class="verse">After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.</p>
<p class="verse">Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse">When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.</p>
<p class="verse">The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</p>
<p class="verse">Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.</p>
<p class="verse">But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:</p>
<p class="verse">But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.</p>
<p class="verse">And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.</p>
<p class="verse">For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.</p>
<p class="verse">And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</p>
<p class="verse">And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.</p>
<p class="verse">Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.</p>
<p class="verse">Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.</p>
<p class="verse">There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews’ preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-john-20">
<h3>Chapter 20</h3>
<p class="verse">The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.</p>
<p class="verse">Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.</p>
<p class="verse">Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.</p>
<p class="verse">So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.</p>
<p class="verse">And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.</p>
<p class="verse">Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,</p>
<p class="verse">And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.</p>
<p class="verse">Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.</p>
<p class="verse">For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.</p>
<p class="verse">But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,</p>
<p class="verse">And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</p>
<p class="verse">And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they have laid him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.</p>
<p class="verse">Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the LORD, and that he had spoken these things unto her.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:</p>
<p class="verse">Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.</p>
<p class="verse">But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</p>
<p class="verse">The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the LORD. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.</p>
<p class="verse">And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.</p>
<p class="verse">And Thomas answered and said unto him, My LORD and my God.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.</p>
<p class="verse">And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:</p>
<p class="verse">But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-john-21">
<h3>Chapter 21</h3>
<p class="verse">After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself.</p>
<p class="verse">There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.</p>
<p class="verse">Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.</p>
<p class="verse">But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher’s coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.</p>
<p class="verse">And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.</p>
<p class="verse">As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.</p>
<p class="verse">Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.</p>
<p class="verse">This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.</p>
<p class="verse">So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.</p>
<p class="verse">He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</p>
<p class="verse">He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</p>
<p class="verse">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.</p>
<p class="verse">This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?</p>
<p class="verse">Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.</p>
<p class="verse">Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?</p>
<p class="verse">This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.</p>
<p class="verse">And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,</p>
<p class="verse">Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:</p>
<p class="verse">To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:</p>
<p class="verse">And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me.</p>
<p class="verse">For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.</p>
<p class="verse">When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.</p>
<p class="verse">But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.</p>
<p class="verse">And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;</p>
<p class="verse">Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day’s journey.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.</p>
<p class="verse">These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.</p>
<p class="verse">And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)</p>
<p class="verse">Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.</p>
<p class="verse">Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.</p>
<p class="verse">For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</p>
<p class="verse">Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.</p>
<p class="verse">And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</p>
<p class="verse">And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,</p>
<p class="verse">That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.</p>
<p class="verse">And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-acts-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.</p>
<p class="verse">And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.</p>
<p class="verse">And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.</p>
<p class="verse">And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</p>
<p class="verse">And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.</p>
<p class="verse">And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?</p>
<p class="verse">And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?</p>
<p class="verse">Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,</p>
<p class="verse">Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,</p>
<p class="verse">Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?</p>
<p class="verse">Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.</p>
<p class="verse">But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:</p>
<p class="verse">For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.</p>
<p class="verse">But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:</p>
<p class="verse">And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:</p>
<p class="verse">And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:</p>
<p class="verse">The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:</p>
<p class="verse">Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:</p>
<p class="verse">Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.</p>
<p class="verse">For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:</p>
<p class="verse">Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.</p>
<p class="verse">Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;</p>
<p class="verse">He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.</p>
<p class="verse">This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.</p>
<p class="verse">For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,</p>
<p class="verse">Until I make thy foes thy footstool.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?</p>
<p class="verse">Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse">For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call.</p>
<p class="verse">And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.</p>
<p class="verse">Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.</p>
<p class="verse">And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</p>
<p class="verse">And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.</p>
<p class="verse">And all that believed were together, and had all things common;</p>
<p class="verse">And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.</p>
<p class="verse">And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,</p>
<p class="verse">Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-acts-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.</p>
<p class="verse">And a certain man lame from his mother’s womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;</p>
<p class="verse">Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.</p>
<p class="verse">And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.</p>
<p class="verse">And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.</p>
<p class="verse">And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the people saw him walking and praising God:</p>
<p class="verse">And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.</p>
<p class="verse">And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon’s, greatly wondering.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?</p>
<p class="verse">The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.</p>
<p class="verse">But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;</p>
<p class="verse">And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.</p>
<p class="verse">And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.</p>
<p class="verse">And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.</p>
<p class="verse">But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.</p>
<p class="verse">Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:</p>
<p class="verse">Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.</p>
<p class="verse">For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</p>
<p class="verse">Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-acts-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,</p>
<p class="verse">Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.</p>
<p class="verse">And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,</p>
<p class="verse">And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?</p>
<p class="verse">Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,</p>
<p class="verse">If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;</p>
<p class="verse">Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.</p>
<p class="verse">This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.</p>
<p class="verse">Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</p>
<p class="verse">Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.</p>
<p class="verse">But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.</p>
<p class="verse">But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.</p>
<p class="verse">And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.</p>
<p class="verse">For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.</p>
<p class="verse">So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done.</p>
<p class="verse">For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.</p>
<p class="verse">And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:</p>
<p class="verse">Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?</p>
<p class="verse">The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,</p>
<p class="verse">For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.</p>
<p class="verse">And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,</p>
<p class="verse">By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.</p>
<p class="verse">And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.</p>
<p class="verse">And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.</p>
<p class="verse">Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,</p>
<p class="verse">And laid them down at the apostles’ feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.</p>
<p class="verse">And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,</p>
<p class="verse">Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles’ feet.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-acts-5">
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,</p>
<p class="verse">And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles’ feet.</p>
<p class="verse">But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?</p>
<p class="verse">Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.</p>
<p class="verse">And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.</p>
<p class="verse">And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.</p>
<p class="verse">And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out.</p>
<p class="verse">Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband.</p>
<p class="verse">And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.</p>
<p class="verse">And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon’s porch.</p>
<p class="verse">And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.</p>
<p class="verse">And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)</p>
<p class="verse">Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.</p>
<p class="verse">There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,</p>
<p class="verse">And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.</p>
<p class="verse">But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,</p>
<p class="verse">Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.</p>
<p class="verse">But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.</p>
<p class="verse">Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.</p>
<p class="verse">Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.</p>
<p class="verse">Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.</p>
<p class="verse">The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.</p>
<p class="verse">Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.</p>
<p class="verse">And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.</p>
<p class="verse">When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them.</p>
<p class="verse">Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;</p>
<p class="verse">And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men.</p>
<p class="verse">For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought.</p>
<p class="verse">After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.</p>
<p class="verse">And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:</p>
<p class="verse">But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.</p>
<p class="verse">And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.</p>
<p class="verse">And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.</p>
<p class="verse">And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.</p>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse">And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.</p>
<p class="verse">But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.</p>
<p class="verse">And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:</p>
<p class="verse">Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.</p>
<p class="verse">And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.</p>
<p class="verse">And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.</p>
<p class="verse">Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.</p>
<p class="verse">And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.</p>
<p class="verse">Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.</p>
<p class="verse">And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,</p>
<p class="verse">And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:</p>
<p class="verse">For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.</p>
<p class="verse">And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="verse">Then said the high priest, Are these things so?</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,</p>
<p class="verse">And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.</p>
<p class="verse">And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.</p>
<p class="verse">And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years.</p>
<p class="verse">And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.</p>
<p class="verse">And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.</p>
<p class="verse">And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,</p>
<p class="verse">And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.</p>
<p class="verse">Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.</p>
<p class="verse">But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first.</p>
<p class="verse">And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph’s kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.</p>
<p class="verse">Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.</p>
<p class="verse">So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,</p>
<p class="verse">And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.</p>
<p class="verse">But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,</p>
<p class="verse">Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.</p>
<p class="verse">The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.</p>
<p class="verse">In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father’s house three months:</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was cast out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.</p>
<p class="verse">And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:</p>
<p class="verse">For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.</p>
<p class="verse">And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?</p>
<p class="verse">But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?</p>
<p class="verse">Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?</p>
<p class="verse">Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.</p>
<p class="verse">And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.</p>
<p class="verse">When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the LORD came unto him,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.</p>
<p class="verse">I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse">This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.</p>
<p class="verse">He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.</p>
<p class="verse">This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.</p>
<p class="verse">This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:</p>
<p class="verse">To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.</p>
<p class="verse">And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.</p>
<p class="verse">Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse">Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.</p>
<p class="verse">Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;</p>
<p class="verse">Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.</p>
<p class="verse">But Solomon built him an house.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,</p>
<p class="verse">Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?</p>
<p class="verse">Hath not my hand made all these things?</p>
<p class="verse">Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye.</p>
<p class="verse">Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:</p>
<p class="verse">Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.</p>
<p class="verse">When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.</p>
<p class="verse">But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,</p>
<p class="verse">And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,</p>
<p class="verse">And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man’s feet, whose name was Saul.</p>
<p class="verse">And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.</p>
<p class="verse">And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-acts-8">
<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="verse">And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.</p>
<p class="verse">And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.</p>
<p class="verse">As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.</p>
<p class="verse">For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.</p>
<p class="verse">And there was great joy in that city.</p>
<p class="verse">But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:</p>
<p class="verse">To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.</p>
<p class="verse">But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.</p>
<p class="verse">Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:</p>
<p class="verse">Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:</p>
<p class="verse">(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)</p>
<p class="verse">Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse">But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</p>
<p class="verse">For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse">Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.</p>
<p class="verse">And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.</p>
<p class="verse">And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.</p>
<p class="verse">And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,</p>
<p class="verse">Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.</p>
<p class="verse">And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</p>
<p class="verse">The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:</p>
<p class="verse">In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?</p>
<p class="verse">Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?</p>
<p class="verse">And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.</p>
<p class="verse">But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
<p class="verse">And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,</p>
<p class="verse">And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:</p>
<p class="verse">And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</p>
<p class="verse">And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.</p>
<p class="verse">And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.</p>
<p class="verse">And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.</p>
<p class="verse">And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,</p>
<p class="verse">And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:</p>
<p class="verse">And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.</p>
<p class="verse">But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:</p>
<p class="verse">For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name’s sake.</p>
<p class="verse">And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse">And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.</p>
<p class="verse">And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse">But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?</p>
<p class="verse">But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:</p>
<p class="verse">But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.</p>
<p class="verse">But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.</p>
<p class="verse">Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.</p>
<p class="verse">Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.</p>
<p class="verse">And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.</p>
<p class="verse">And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.</p>
<p class="verse">And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber.</p>
<p class="verse">And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.</p>
<p class="verse">But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.</p>
<p class="verse">And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-acts-10">
<h3>Chapter 10</h3>
<p class="verse">There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,</p>
<p class="verse">A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.</p>
<p class="verse">He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.</p>
<p class="verse">And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter:</p>
<p class="verse">He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.</p>
<p class="verse">On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:</p>
<p class="verse">And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,</p>
<p class="verse">And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:</p>
<p class="verse">Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</p>
<p class="verse">And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.</p>
<p class="verse">But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.</p>
<p class="verse">And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.</p>
<p class="verse">This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon’s house, and stood before the gate,</p>
<p class="verse">And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.</p>
<p class="verse">While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?</p>
<p class="verse">And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.</p>
<p class="verse">And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.</p>
<p class="verse">And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.</p>
<p class="verse">But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.</p>
<p class="verse">And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?</p>
<p class="verse">And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,</p>
<p class="verse">And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:</p>
<p class="verse">But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.</p>
<p class="verse">The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)</p>
<p class="verse">That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;</p>
<p class="verse">How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.</p>
<p class="verse">And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:</p>
<p class="verse">Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;</p>
<p class="verse">Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.</p>
<p class="verse">And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.</p>
<p class="verse">To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.</p>
<p class="verse">While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.</p>
<p class="verse">And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse">For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,</p>
<p class="verse">Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?</p>
<p class="verse">And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-acts-11">
<h3>Chapter 11</h3>
<p class="verse">And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.</p>
<p class="verse">But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:</p>
<p class="verse">Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</p>
<p class="verse">And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.</p>
<p class="verse">But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse">But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.</p>
<p class="verse">And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man’s house:</p>
<p class="verse">And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;</p>
<p class="verse">Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved.</p>
<p class="verse">And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.</p>
<p class="verse">Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse">Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?</p>
<p class="verse">When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.</p>
<p class="verse">Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.</p>
<p class="verse">And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.</p>
<p class="verse">Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.</p>
<p class="verse">And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.</p>
<p class="verse">And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:</p>
<p class="verse">Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-acts-12">
<h3>Chapter 12</h3>
<p class="verse">Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.</p>
<p class="verse">And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.</p>
<p class="verse">And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.</p>
<p class="verse">Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.</p>
<p class="verse">And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.</p>
<p class="verse">And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.</p>
<p class="verse">When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the LORD hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.</p>
<p class="verse">And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.</p>
<p class="verse">And when she knew Peter’s voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.</p>
<p class="verse">And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.</p>
<p class="verse">But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished.</p>
<p class="verse">But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.</p>
<p class="verse">Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode.</p>
<p class="verse">And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king’s chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king’s country.</p>
<p class="verse">And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.</p>
<p class="verse">And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.</p>
<p class="verse">But the word of God grew and multiplied.</p>
<p class="verse">And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-acts-13">
<h3>Chapter 13</h3>
<p class="verse">Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.</p>
<p class="verse">As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.</p>
<p class="verse">So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their minister.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus:</p>
<p class="verse">Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.</p>
<p class="verse">But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him,</p>
<p class="verse">And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?</p>
<p class="verse">And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.</p>
<p class="verse">And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.</p>
<p class="verse">The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.</p>
<p class="verse">And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.</p>
<p class="verse">And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.</p>
<p class="verse">And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.</p>
<p class="verse">Of this man’s seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:</p>
<p class="verse">When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose.</p>
<p class="verse">Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.</p>
<p class="verse">For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.</p>
<p class="verse">And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.</p>
<p class="verse">But God raised him from the dead:</p>
<p class="verse">And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.</p>
<p class="verse">And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers,</p>
<p class="verse">God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</p>
<p class="verse">For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:</p>
<p class="verse">But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.</p>
<p class="verse">Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:</p>
<p class="verse">And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.</p>
<p class="verse">Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.</p>
<p class="verse">Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.</p>
<p class="verse">But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="verse">For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.</p>
<p class="verse">And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.</p>
<p class="verse">But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.</p>
<p class="verse">But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.</p>
<p class="verse">And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-acts-14">
<h3>Chapter 14</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.</p>
<p class="verse">But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren.</p>
<p class="verse">Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.</p>
<p class="verse">But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.</p>
<p class="verse">And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them,</p>
<p class="verse">They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about:</p>
<p class="verse">And there they preached the gospel.</p>
<p class="verse">And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother’s womb, who never had walked:</p>
<p class="verse">The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,</p>
<p class="verse">Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.</p>
<p class="verse">And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.</p>
<p class="verse">Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,</p>
<p class="verse">And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:</p>
<p class="verse">Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.</p>
<p class="verse">And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,</p>
<p class="verse">Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.</p>
<p class="verse">And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia:</p>
<p class="verse">And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="verse">And there they abode long time with the disciples.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-acts-15">
<h3>Chapter 15</h3>
<p class="verse">And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.</p>
<p class="verse">When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.</p>
<p class="verse">And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.</p>
<p class="verse">But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.</p>
<p class="verse">And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.</p>
<p class="verse">And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.</p>
<p class="verse">And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us;</p>
<p class="verse">And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</p>
<p class="verse">But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.</p>
<p class="verse">Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.</p>
<p class="verse">And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me:</p>
<p class="verse">Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.</p>
<p class="verse">And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,</p>
<p class="verse">After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:</p>
<p class="verse">That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.</p>
<p class="verse">Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:</p>
<p class="verse">But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.</p>
<p class="verse">For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.</p>
<p class="verse">Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:</p>
<p class="verse">And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia:</p>
<p class="verse">Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:</p>
<p class="verse">It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</p>
<p class="verse">Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth.</p>
<p class="verse">For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;</p>
<p class="verse">That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.</p>
<p class="verse">So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:</p>
<p class="verse">Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.</p>
<p class="verse">And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.</p>
<p class="verse">And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.</p>
<p class="verse">Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.</p>
<p class="verse">Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</p>
<p class="verse">And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the LORD, and see how they do.</p>
<p class="verse">And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.</p>
<p class="verse">But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.</p>
<p class="verse">And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;</p>
<p class="verse">And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-acts-16">
<h3>Chapter 16</h3>
<p class="verse">Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:</p>
<p class="verse">Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.</p>
<p class="verse">Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.</p>
<p class="verse">And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.</p>
<p class="verse">Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,</p>
<p class="verse">After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.</p>
<p class="verse">And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.</p>
<p class="verse">And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.</p>
<p class="verse">And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;</p>
<p class="verse">And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.</p>
<p class="verse">And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither.</p>
<p class="verse">And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.</p>
<p class="verse">And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:</p>
<p class="verse">The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.</p>
<p class="verse">And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.</p>
<p class="verse">And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,</p>
<p class="verse">And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,</p>
<p class="verse">And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.</p>
<p class="verse">And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:</p>
<p class="verse">Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.</p>
<p class="verse">And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.</p>
<p class="verse">And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bands were loosed.</p>
<p class="verse">And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.</p>
<p class="verse">But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.</p>
<p class="verse">Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,</p>
<p class="verse">And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</p>
<p class="verse">And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.</p>
<p class="verse">And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.</p>
<p class="verse">And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.</p>
<p class="verse">And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.</p>
<p class="verse">But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.</p>
<p class="verse">And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.</p>
<p class="verse">And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city.</p>
<p class="verse">And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.</p>

<h3>Chapter 17</h3>
<p class="verse">Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:</p>
<p class="verse">And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,</p>
<p class="verse">Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.</p>
<p class="verse">But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;</p>
<p class="verse">Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.</p>
<p class="verse">And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse">These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.</p>
<p class="verse">But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.</p>
<p class="verse">And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.</p>
<p class="verse">And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.</p>
<p class="verse">Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.</p>
<p class="verse">And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?</p>
<p class="verse">For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.</p>
<p class="verse">(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)</p>
<p class="verse">Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars’ hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.</p>
<p class="verse">For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;</p>
<p class="verse">Neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;</p>
<p class="verse">And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;</p>
<p class="verse">That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:</p>
<p class="verse">For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.</p>
<p class="verse">Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man’s device.</p>
<p class="verse">And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:</p>
<p class="verse">Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.</p>
<p class="verse">So Paul departed from among them.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-acts-18">
<h3>Chapter 18</h3>
<p class="verse">After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;</p>
<p class="verse">And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.</p>
<p class="verse">And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="verse">And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man’s house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.</p>
<p class="verse">And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.</p>
<p class="verse">Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:</p>
<p class="verse">For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.</p>
<p class="verse">And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:</p>
<p class="verse">But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.</p>
<p class="verse">And he drave them from the judgment seat.</p>
<p class="verse">Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.</p>
<p class="verse">And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.</p>
<p class="verse">And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse">When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;</p>
<p class="verse">But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.</p>
<p class="verse">And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.</p>
<p class="verse">And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.</p>
<p class="verse">This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.</p>
<p class="verse">And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:</p>
<p class="verse">For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-acts-19">
<h3>Chapter 19</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,</p>
<p class="verse">He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John’s baptism.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the men were about twelve.</p>
<p class="verse">And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse">But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</p>
<p class="verse">And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</p>
<p class="verse">And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:</p>
<p class="verse">So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.</p>
<p class="verse">Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.</p>
<p class="verse">And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so.</p>
<p class="verse">And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?</p>
<p class="verse">And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</p>
<p class="verse">And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</p>
<p class="verse">And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.</p>
<p class="verse">Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.</p>
<p class="verse">So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.</p>
<p class="verse">After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.</p>
<p class="verse">So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.</p>
<p class="verse">And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.</p>
<p class="verse">For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;</p>
<p class="verse">Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:</p>
<p class="verse">So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</p>
<p class="verse">And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.</p>
<p class="verse">And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.</p>
<p class="verse">Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.</p>
<p class="verse">And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.</p>
<p class="verse">But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?</p>
<p class="verse">Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.</p>
<p class="verse">For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.</p>
<p class="verse">But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.</p>
<p class="verse">For we are in danger to be called in question for this day’s uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-acts-20">
<h3>Chapter 20</h3>
<p class="verse">And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,</p>
<p class="verse">And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.</p>
<p class="verse">And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.</p>
<p class="verse">These going before tarried for us at Troas.</p>
<p class="verse">And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.</p>
<p class="verse">And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.</p>
<p class="verse">And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.</p>
<p class="verse">And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.</p>
<p class="verse">And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.</p>
<p class="verse">When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.</p>
<p class="verse">And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.</p>
<p class="verse">And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.</p>
<p class="verse">And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus.</p>
<p class="verse">For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.</p>
<p class="verse">And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,</p>
<p class="verse">Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:</p>
<p class="verse">And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,</p>
<p class="verse">Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:</p>
<p class="verse">Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.</p>
<p class="verse">But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.</p>
<p class="verse">For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.</p>
<p class="verse">For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</p>
<p class="verse">Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.</p>
<p class="verse">And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.</p>
<p class="verse">I have coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.</p>
<p class="verse">I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.</p>
<p class="verse">And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul’s neck, and kissed him,</p>
<p class="verse">Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-acts-21">
<h3>Chapter 21</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:</p>
<p class="verse">And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth.</p>
<p class="verse">Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden.</p>
<p class="verse">And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.</p>
<p class="verse">And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again.</p>
<p class="verse">And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.</p>
<p class="verse">And the next day we that were of Paul’s company departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him.</p>
<p class="verse">And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.</p>
<p class="verse">And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was come unto us, he took Paul’s girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="verse">And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.</p>
<p class="verse">And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.</p>
<p class="verse">And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.</p>
<p class="verse">And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:</p>
<p class="verse">And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.</p>
<p class="verse">What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.</p>
<p class="verse">Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;</p>
<p class="verse">Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.</p>
<p class="verse">As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,</p>
<p class="verse">Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place.</p>
<p class="verse">(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)</p>
<p class="verse">And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut.</p>
<p class="verse">And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.</p>
<p class="verse">Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.</p>
<p class="verse">And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people.</p>
<p class="verse">For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.</p>
<p class="verse">And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?</p>
<p class="verse">Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?</p>
<p class="verse">But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-acts-22">
<h3>Chapter 22</h3>
<p class="verse">Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make now unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">(And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)</p>
<p class="verse">I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.</p>
<p class="verse">And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.</p>
<p class="verse">As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.</p>
<p class="verse">And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</p>
<p class="verse">And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.</p>
<p class="verse">And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.</p>
<p class="verse">And I said, What shall I do, LORD? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.</p>
<p class="verse">And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.</p>
<p class="verse">And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,</p>
<p class="verse">Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse">For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.</p>
<p class="verse">And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;</p>
<p class="verse">And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.</p>
<p class="verse">And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:</p>
<p class="verse">And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="verse">And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.</p>
<p class="verse">And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,</p>
<p class="verse">The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.</p>
<p class="verse">And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?</p>
<p class="verse">When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.</p>
<p class="verse">And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.</p>
<p class="verse">Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.</p>
<p class="verse">On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-acts-23">
<h3>Chapter 23</h3>
<p class="verse">And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.</p>
<p class="verse">And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?</p>
<p class="verse">And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God’s high priest?</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.</p>
<p class="verse">But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.</p>
<p class="verse">For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.</p>
<p class="verse">And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees’ part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.</p>
<p class="verse">And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle.</p>
<p class="verse">And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.</p>
<p class="verse">And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.</p>
<p class="verse">And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.</p>
<p class="verse">And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Paul’s sister’s son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.</p>
<p class="verse">So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.</p>
<p class="verse">But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.</p>
<p class="verse">So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.</p>
<p class="verse">And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;</p>
<p class="verse">And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor.</p>
<p class="verse">And he wrote a letter after this manner:</p>
<p class="verse">Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting.</p>
<p class="verse">This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.</p>
<p class="verse">And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:</p>
<p class="verse">Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.</p>
<p class="verse">And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.</p>
<p class="verse">On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:</p>
<p class="verse">Who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia;</p>
<p class="verse">I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod’s judgment hall.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-acts-24">
<h3>Chapter 24</h3>
<p class="verse">And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,</p>
<p class="verse">We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.</p>
<p class="verse">Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.</p>
<p class="verse">For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:</p>
<p class="verse">Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.</p>
<p class="verse">But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,</p>
<p class="verse">Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:</p>
<p class="verse">Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.</p>
<p class="verse">And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:</p>
<p class="verse">Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.</p>
<p class="verse">But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:</p>
<p class="verse">And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.</p>
<p class="verse">And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men.</p>
<p class="verse">Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.</p>
<p class="verse">Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.</p>
<p class="verse">Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.</p>
<p class="verse">Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,</p>
<p class="verse">Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.</p>
<p class="verse">And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.</p>
<p class="verse">And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.</p>
<p class="verse">He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.</p>
<p class="verse">But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix’ room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-acts-25">
<h3>Chapter 25</h3>
<p class="verse">Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,</p>
<p class="verse">And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.</p>
<p class="verse">But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither.</p>
<p class="verse">Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.</p>
<p class="verse">While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.</p>
<p class="verse">But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.</p>
<p class="verse">For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.</p>
<p class="verse">And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul’s cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:</p>
<p class="verse">About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.</p>
<p class="verse">To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.</p>
<p class="verse">Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:</p>
<p class="verse">But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</p>
<p class="verse">And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.</p>
<p class="verse">But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.</p>
<p class="verse">And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus’ commandment Paul was brought forth.</p>
<p class="verse">And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.</p>
<p class="verse">But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.</p>
<p class="verse">Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.</p>
<p class="verse">For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-acts-26">
<h3>Chapter 26</h3>
<p class="verse">Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:</p>
<p class="verse">I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:</p>
<p class="verse">Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.</p>
<p class="verse">My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;</p>
<p class="verse">Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</p>
<p class="verse">And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:</p>
<p class="verse">Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope’s sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse">Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?</p>
<p class="verse">I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p class="verse">Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.</p>
<p class="verse">And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.</p>
<p class="verse">Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,</p>
<p class="verse">At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.</p>
<p class="verse">And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</p>
<p class="verse">And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.</p>
<p class="verse">But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;</p>
<p class="verse">Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,</p>
<p class="verse">To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.</p>
<p class="verse">Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:</p>
<p class="verse">But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.</p>
<p class="verse">For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me.</p>
<p class="verse">Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:</p>
<p class="verse">That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="verse">And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.</p>
<p class="verse">But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.</p>
<p class="verse">For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.</p>
<p class="verse">King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.</p>
<p class="verse">And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:</p>
<p class="verse">And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-acts-27">
<h3>Chapter 27</h3>
<p class="verse">And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus’ band.</p>
<p class="verse">And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.</p>
<p class="verse">And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.</p>
<p class="verse">And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</p>
<p class="verse">And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.</p>
<p class="verse">And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.</p>
<p class="verse">And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;</p>
<p class="verse">And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.</p>
<p class="verse">Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,</p>
<p class="verse">And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.</p>
<p class="verse">And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.</p>
<p class="verse">But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.</p>
<p class="verse">And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:</p>
<p class="verse">Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.</p>
<p class="verse">And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;</p>
<p class="verse">And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.</p>
<p class="verse">And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.</p>
<p class="verse">But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.</p>
<p class="verse">And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man’s life among you, but of the ship.</p>
<p class="verse">For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.</p>
<p class="verse">But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;</p>
<p class="verse">And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.</p>
<p class="verse">Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.</p>
<p class="verse">And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,</p>
<p class="verse">Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</p>
<p class="verse">And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.</p>
<p class="verse">Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.</p>
<p class="verse">And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.</p>
<p class="verse">And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.</p>
<p class="verse">And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.</p>
<p class="verse">And the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.</p>
<p class="verse">But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:</p>
<p class="verse">And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.</p>

<h3>Chapter 28</h3>
<p class="verse">And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.</p>
<p class="verse">And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</p>
<p class="verse">In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.</p>
<p class="verse">So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:</p>
<p class="verse">Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.</p>
<p class="verse">And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</p>
<p class="verse">And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.</p>
<p class="verse">And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:</p>
<p class="verse">Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.</p>
<p class="verse">And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</p>
<p class="verse">And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</p>
<p class="verse">Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.</p>
<p class="verse">But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.</p>
<p class="verse">For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</p>
<p class="verse">And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.</p>
<p class="verse">But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.</p>
<p class="verse">And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:</p>
<p class="verse">For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</p>
<p class="verse">Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.</p>
<p class="verse">And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,</p>
<p class="verse">Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</p>
<p class="verse">My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;</p>
<p class="verse">Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</p>
<p class="verse">But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</p>
<p class="verse">If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</p>
<p class="verse">But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</p>
<p class="verse">For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.</p>
<p class="verse">Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:</p>
<p class="verse">But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</p>
<p class="verse">For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</p>
<p class="verse">Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:</p>
<p class="verse">But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.</p>
<p class="verse">Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</p>
<p class="verse">Do not err, my beloved brethren.</p>
<p class="verse">Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</p>
<p class="verse">Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</p>
<p class="verse">For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</p>
<p class="verse">But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</p>
<p class="verse">For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</p>
<p class="verse">For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</p>
<p class="verse">But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</p>
<p class="verse">If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.</p>
<p class="verse">Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-james-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.</p>
<p class="verse">For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;</p>
<p class="verse">And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:</p>
<p class="verse">Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</p>
<p class="verse">Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?</p>
<p class="verse">But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?</p>
<p class="verse">Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?</p>
<p class="verse">If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:</p>
<p class="verse">But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.</p>
<p class="verse">For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</p>
<p class="verse">For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</p>
<p class="verse">So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</p>
<p class="verse">For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.</p>
<p class="verse">What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?</p>
<p class="verse">If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,</p>
<p class="verse">And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?</p>
<p class="verse">Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</p>
<p class="verse">But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</p>
<p class="verse">Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</p>
<p class="verse">Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?</p>
<p class="verse">And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?</p>
<p class="verse">For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-james-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.</p>
<p class="verse">For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.</p>
<p class="verse">Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!</p>
<p class="verse">And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.</p>
<p class="verse">For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:</p>
<p class="verse">But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.</p>
<p class="verse">Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</p>
<p class="verse">Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?</p>
<p class="verse">Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.</p>
<p class="verse">Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse">But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.</p>
<p class="verse">For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.</p>
<p class="verse">But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.</p>
<p class="verse">And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-james-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?</p>
<p class="verse">Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?</p>
<p class="verse">But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.</p>
<p class="verse">Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</p>
<p class="verse">Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.</p>
<p class="verse">Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.</p>
<p class="verse">Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.</p>
<p class="verse">Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.</p>
<p class="verse">There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?</p>
<p class="verse">Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:</p>
<p class="verse">Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.</p>
<p class="verse">For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.</p>
<p class="verse">But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-james-5">
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you.</p>
<p class="verse">Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.</p>
<p class="verse">Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.</p>
<p class="verse">Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.</p>
<p class="verse">Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.</p>
<p class="verse">Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.</p>
<p class="verse">Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.</p>
<p class="verse">But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.</p>
<p class="verse">Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.</p>
<p class="verse">Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:</p>
<p class="verse">And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.</p>
<p class="verse">Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</p>
<p class="verse">Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.</p>
<p class="verse">And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.</p>
<p class="verse">Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;</p>
<p class="verse">Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,</p>
<p class="verse">Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</p>
<p class="verse">To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,</p>
<p class="verse">Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:</p>
<p class="verse">That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse">Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:</p>
<p class="verse">Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.</p>
<p class="verse">Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:</p>
<p class="verse">Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.</p>
<p class="verse">Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;</p>
<p class="verse">As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:</p>
<p class="verse">But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;</p>
<p class="verse">Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.</p>
<p class="verse">And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man’s work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:</p>
<p class="verse">Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;</p>
<p class="verse">But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:</p>
<p class="verse">Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,</p>
<p class="verse">Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.</p>
<p class="verse">Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently:</p>
<p class="verse">Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:</p>
<p class="verse">But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 peter-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,</p>
<p class="verse">As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:</p>
<p class="verse">If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.</p>
<p class="verse">To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,</p>
<p class="verse">Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.</p>
<p class="verse">Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,</p>
<p class="verse">And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.</p>
<p class="verse">But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:</p>
<p class="verse">Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</p>
<p class="verse">Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;</p>
<p class="verse">Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.</p>
<p class="verse">Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;</p>
<p class="verse">Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.</p>
<p class="verse">For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:</p>
<p class="verse">As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.</p>
<p class="verse">Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.</p>
<p class="verse">For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.</p>
<p class="verse">For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.</p>
<p class="verse">For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:</p>
<p class="verse">Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:</p>
<p class="verse">Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:</p>
<p class="verse">Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.</p>
<p class="verse">For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 peter-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;</p>
<p class="verse">While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.</p>
<p class="verse">Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;</p>
<p class="verse">But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.</p>
<p class="verse">For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:</p>
<p class="verse">Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.</p>
<p class="verse">Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:</p>
<p class="verse">Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.</p>
<p class="verse">For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:</p>
<p class="verse">Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.</p>
<p class="verse">For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.</p>
<p class="verse">And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?</p>
<p class="verse">But and if ye suffer for righteousness’ sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;</p>
<p class="verse">But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:</p>
<p class="verse">Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.</p>
<p class="verse">For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:</p>
<p class="verse">By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;</p>
<p class="verse">Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.</p>
<p class="verse">The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse">Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;</p>
<p class="verse">That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.</p>
<p class="verse">For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:</p>
<p class="verse">Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:</p>
<p class="verse">Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.</p>
<p class="verse">For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.</p>
<p class="verse">But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.</p>
<p class="verse">And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.</p>
<p class="verse">Use hospitality one to another without grudging.</p>
<p class="verse">As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</p>
<p class="verse">If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:</p>
<p class="verse">But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.</p>
<p class="verse">If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.</p>
<p class="verse">But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men’s matters.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.</p>
<p class="verse">For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?</p>
<p class="verse">And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:</p>
<p class="verse">Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;</p>
<p class="verse">Neither as being lords over God’s heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</p>
<p class="verse">Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:</p>
<p class="verse">Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.</p>
<p class="verse">Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:</p>
<p class="verse">Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.</p>
<p class="verse">But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.</p>
<p class="verse">To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.</p>
<p class="verse">The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son.</p>
<p class="verse">Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>
