<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.</p>
<p class="verse">But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.</p>
<p class="verse">The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</p>
<p class="verse">For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-psalms-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?</p>
<p class="verse">The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.</p>
<p class="verse">He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have them in derision.</p>
<p class="verse">Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.</p>
<p class="verse">I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.</p>
<p class="verse">Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</p>
<p class="verse">Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-psalms-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up against me.</p>
<p class="verse">Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.</p>
<p class="verse">But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.</p>
<p class="verse">I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.</p>
<p class="verse">I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.</p>
<p class="verse">I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.</p>
<p class="verse">Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.</p>
<p class="verse">Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-psalms-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.</p>
<p class="verse">O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.</p>
<p class="verse">But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.</p>
<p class="verse">Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.</p>
<p class="verse">Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.</p>
<p class="verse">I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-psalms-5">
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.</p>
<p class="verse">Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.</p>
<p class="verse">My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.</p>
<p class="verse">For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.</p>
<p class="verse">The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.</p>
<p class="verse">But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.</p>
<p class="verse">Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.</p>
<p class="verse">For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.</p>
<p class="verse">Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.</p>
<p class="verse">But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.</p>
<p class="verse">For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-psalms-6">
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse">O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.</p>
<p class="verse">Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.</p>
<p class="verse">My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?</p>
<p class="verse">Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies’ sake.</p>
<p class="verse">For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?</p>
<p class="verse">I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.</p>
<p class="verse">Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.</p>
<p class="verse">Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.</p>
<p class="verse">Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-psalms-7">
<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="verse">O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:</p>
<p class="verse">Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.</p>
<p class="verse">O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;</p>
<p class="verse">If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)</p>
<p class="verse">Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.</p>
<p class="verse">Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.</p>
<p class="verse">So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.</p>
<p class="verse">Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.</p>

<p class="verse">I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</p>
<p class="verse">The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.</p>
<p class="verse">The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.</p>
<p class="verse">In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.</p>
<p class="verse">There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</p>
<p class="verse">He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.</p>
<p class="verse">And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.</p>
<p class="verse">He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.</p>
<p class="verse">At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.</p>
<p class="verse">He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.</p>
<p class="verse">He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.</p>
<p class="verse">They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.</p>
<p class="verse">He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</p>
<p class="verse">For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</p>
<p class="verse">For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.</p>
<p class="verse">I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.</p>
<p class="verse">With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;</p>
<p class="verse">With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.</p>
<p class="verse">For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.</p>
<p class="verse">For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.</p>
<p class="verse">For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.</p>
<p class="verse">As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.</p>
<p class="verse">For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?</p>
<p class="verse">It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.</p>
<p class="verse">He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet, and setteth me upon my high places.</p>
<p class="verse">He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.</p>
<p class="verse">I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.</p>
<p class="verse">I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.</p>
<p class="verse">For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.</p>
<p class="verse">They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.</p>
<p class="verse">Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.</p>
<p class="verse">As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.</p>
<p class="verse">The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.</p>
<p class="verse">It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.</p>
<p class="verse">He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.</p>

<p class="verse">One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.</p>

<p class="verse">And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.</p>
<p class="verse">When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek.</p>

<p class="verse">O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.</p>

<p class="verse">My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.</p>
<p class="verse">They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.</p>
<p class="verse">But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.</p>
<p class="verse">For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.</p>
<p class="verse">For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.</p>

<p class="verse">For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.</p>
<p class="verse">But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.</p>

<p class="verse">Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.</p>

<p class="verse">Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.</p>
<p class="verse">God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah.</p>
<p class="verse">The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:</p>
<p class="verse">Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.</p>
<p class="verse">But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.</p>
<p class="verse">I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I will wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints.</p>

<h3>Chapter 53</h3>
<p class="verse">The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.</p>
<p class="verse">God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.</p>
<p class="verse">Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</p>
<p class="verse">Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread: they have not called upon God.</p>
<p class="verse">There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them.</p>
<p class="verse">Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.</p>

<p class="verse">Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.</p>
<p class="verse">Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;</p>
<p class="verse">Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.</p>
<p class="verse">My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.</p>
<p class="verse">Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.</p>
<p class="verse">And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest.</p>
<p class="verse">Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah.</p>
<p class="verse">I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.</p>
<p class="verse">Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.</p>
<p class="verse">Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.</p>
<p class="verse">Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.</p>
<p class="verse">For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:</p>
<p class="verse">But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.</p>
<p class="verse">We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.</p>
<p class="verse">Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.</p>
<p class="verse">As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.</p>
<p class="verse">Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.</p>
<p class="verse">He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me.</p>
<p class="verse">God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.</p>
<p class="verse">He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.</p>
<p class="verse">The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.</p>
<p class="verse">Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.</p>
<p class="verse">But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.</p>

<p class="verse">Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.</p>
<p class="verse">I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother’s children.</p>
<p class="verse">For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</p>
<p class="verse">When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.</p>
<p class="verse">I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.</p>
<p class="verse">They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards.</p>
<p class="verse">But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.</p>
<p class="verse">Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.</p>
<p class="verse">Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.</p>
<p class="verse">Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.</p>
<p class="verse">And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.</p>
<p class="verse">Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.</p>
<p class="verse">They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</p>
<p class="verse">Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.</p>
<p class="verse">Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.</p>
<p class="verse">Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.</p>
<p class="verse">Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.</p>
<p class="verse">For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.</p>
<p class="verse">Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse">Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.</p>
<p class="verse">But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.</p>
<p class="verse">I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="verse">This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.</p>
<p class="verse">The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.</p>
<p class="verse">For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.</p>
<p class="verse">Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.</p>
<p class="verse">For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.</p>
<p class="verse">The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.</p>

<p class="verse">Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.</p>
<p class="verse">But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.</p>
<p class="verse">For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse">For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.</p>
<p class="verse">They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.</p>
<p class="verse">Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.</p>
<p class="verse">They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.</p>
<p class="verse">They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.</p>
<p class="verse">And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.</p>
<p class="verse">Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.</p>
<p class="verse">For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.</p>
<p class="verse">If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children.</p>
<p class="verse">When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;</p>
<p class="verse">Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.</p>
<p class="verse">Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.</p>
<p class="verse">How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.</p>
<p class="verse">As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.</p>
<p class="verse">So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.</p>
<p class="verse">Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.</p>
<p class="verse">My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.</p>
<p class="verse">But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.</p>

<p class="verse">O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?</p>

<p class="verse">Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.</p>
<p class="verse">Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs.</p>
<p class="verse">A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.</p>
<p class="verse">But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.</p>
<p class="verse">They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.</p>
<p class="verse">They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.</p>
<p class="verse">We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.</p>
<p class="verse">O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?</p>
<p class="verse">Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom.</p>
<p class="verse">For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.</p>
<p class="verse">The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.</p>
<p class="verse">Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.</p>
<p class="verse">O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.</p>
<p class="verse">O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name.</p>
<p class="verse">Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.</p>
<p class="verse">Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.</p>

<h3>Chapter 78</h3>
<p class="verse">Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse">I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:</p>
<p class="verse">Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</p>
<p class="verse">We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.</p>
<p class="verse">For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:</p>
<p class="verse">That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:</p>
<p class="verse">That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:</p>
<p class="verse">And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.</p>
<p class="verse">The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.</p>
<p class="verse">They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;</p>
<p class="verse">And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.</p>
<p class="verse">Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</p>
<p class="verse">He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.</p>
<p class="verse">In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.</p>
<p class="verse">He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.</p>
<p class="verse">He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</p>
<p class="verse">And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse">And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;</p>
<p class="verse">Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:</p>
<p class="verse">Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,</p>
<p class="verse">And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full.</p>
<p class="verse">He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.</p>
<p class="verse">He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:</p>
<p class="verse">And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.</p>
<p class="verse">So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;</p>
<p class="verse">They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,</p>
<p class="verse">The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.</p>
<p class="verse">When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.</p>
<p class="verse">And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.</p>
<p class="verse">For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.</p>
<p class="verse">But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.</p>
<p class="verse">For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</p>
<p class="verse">How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.</p>
<p class="verse">How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:</p>
<p class="verse">And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.</p>
<p class="verse">He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</p>
<p class="verse">He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.</p>
<p class="verse">He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.</p>
<p class="verse">He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</p>
<p class="verse">He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.</p>
<p class="verse">He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;</p>
<p class="verse">And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:</p>
<p class="verse">But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</p>
<p class="verse">And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</p>
<p class="verse">And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.</p>
<p class="verse">He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</p>
<p class="verse">But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</p>
<p class="verse">For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</p>
<p class="verse">When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</p>
<p class="verse">So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;</p>
<p class="verse">And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand.</p>
<p class="verse">He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse">The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.</p>
<p class="verse">Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</p>
<p class="verse">And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</p>
<p class="verse">But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</p>
<p class="verse">And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</p>
<p class="verse">From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse">So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.</p>

<p class="verse">He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law;</p>
<p class="verse">That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse">For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse">But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it.</p>
<p class="verse">Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?</p>
<p class="verse">Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence.</p>
<p class="verse">When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.</p>
<p class="verse">In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.</p>
<p class="verse">Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?</p>
<p class="verse">They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.</p>
<p class="verse">But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut them off.</p>

<p class="verse">Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;</p>
<p class="verse">Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;</p>
<p class="verse">Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle’s.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.</p>
<p class="verse">He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.</p>
<p class="verse">He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.</p>
<p class="verse">For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.</p>
<p class="verse">As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.</p>
<p class="verse">Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.</p>

<h3>Chapter 104</h3>
<p class="verse">Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.</p>
<p class="verse">Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:</p>
<p class="verse">Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:</p>
<p class="verse">Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:</p>
<p class="verse">Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.</p>
<p class="verse">At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.</p>
<p class="verse">They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.</p>
<p class="verse">They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.</p>
<p class="verse">By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches.</p>
<p class="verse">He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.</p>
<p class="verse">He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;</p>
<p class="verse">And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man’s heart.</p>
<p class="verse">The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;</p>
<p class="verse">Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house.</p>
<p class="verse">The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies.</p>
<p class="verse">He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.</p>
<p class="verse">The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.</p>
<p class="verse">The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.</p>
<p class="verse">Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.</p>
<p class="verse">O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.</p>
<p class="verse">So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.</p>
<p class="verse">There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.</p>
<p class="verse">These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.</p>
<p class="verse">That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.</p>
<p class="verse">He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.</p>
<p class="verse">I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.</p>
<p class="verse">My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.</p>

<p class="verse">Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;</p>
<p class="verse">O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.</p>
<p class="verse">He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.</p>
<p class="verse">Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;</p>
<p class="verse">And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:</p>
<p class="verse">When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.</p>
<p class="verse">When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;</p>
<p class="verse">He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.</p>
<p class="verse">He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:</p>
<p class="verse">Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:</p>
<p class="verse">Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.</p>
<p class="verse">The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.</p>
<p class="verse">He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:</p>
<p class="verse">To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse">Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.</p>
<p class="verse">And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.</p>
<p class="verse">He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.</p>
<p class="verse">He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.</p>
<p class="verse">They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.</p>
<p class="verse">He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.</p>
<p class="verse">He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.</p>
<p class="verse">Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.</p>
<p class="verse">He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts.</p>
<p class="verse">He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.</p>
<p class="verse">He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.</p>
<p class="verse">He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,</p>
<p class="verse">And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.</p>
<p class="verse">He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.</p>
<p class="verse">He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.</p>
<p class="verse">Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.</p>
<p class="verse">He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.</p>
<p class="verse">The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.</p>
<p class="verse">For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.</p>
<p class="verse">And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness:</p>
<p class="verse">And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;</p>

<p class="verse">Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise?</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times.</p>
<p class="verse">Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;</p>
<p class="verse">That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse">We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</p>
<p class="verse">Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.</p>
<p class="verse">He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse">And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</p>
<p class="verse">And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.</p>
<p class="verse">Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.</p>
<p class="verse">They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:</p>
<p class="verse">But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.</p>
<p class="verse">And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.</p>
<p class="verse">They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.</p>
<p class="verse">And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse">They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.</p>
<p class="verse">They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;</p>
<p class="verse">Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:</p>
<p class="verse">But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:</p>
<p class="verse">To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.</p>
<p class="verse">They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.</p>
<p class="verse">Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.</p>
<p class="verse">And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.</p>
<p class="verse">They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:</p>
<p class="verse">Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.</p>
<p class="verse">They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:</p>
<p class="verse">But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.</p>
<p class="verse">And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,</p>
<p class="verse">And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse">And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.</p>
<p class="verse">Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.</p>
<p class="verse">Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:</p>
<p class="verse">And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.</p>
<p class="verse">He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.</p>
<p class="verse">Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.</p>

<p class="verse">O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;</p>
<p class="verse">And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.</p>
<p class="verse">They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.</p>
<p class="verse">Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.</p>
<p class="verse">Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.</p>
<p class="verse">And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.</p>
<p class="verse">Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p class="verse">For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.</p>
<p class="verse">Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron;</p>
<p class="verse">Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.</p>
<p class="verse">Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.</p>
<p class="verse">He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.</p>
<p class="verse">Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p class="verse">For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.</p>
<p class="verse">Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.</p>
<p class="verse">Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.</p>
<p class="verse">Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses.</p>
<p class="verse">He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.</p>
<p class="verse">Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p class="verse">And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.</p>
<p class="verse">They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;</p>
<p class="verse">These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.</p>
<p class="verse">For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.</p>
<p class="verse">They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit’s end.</p>
<p class="verse">Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.</p>
<p class="verse">He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.</p>
<p class="verse">Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.</p>
<p class="verse">Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p class="verse">Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.</p>
<p class="verse">He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;</p>
<p class="verse">A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.</p>
<p class="verse">He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.</p>
<p class="verse">And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;</p>
<p class="verse">And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.</p>
<p class="verse">He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.</p>
<p class="verse">Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.</p>
<p class="verse">He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.</p>
<p class="verse">The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.</p>
<p class="verse">Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.</p>

<h3>Chapter 108</h3>
<p class="verse">O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.</p>
<p class="verse">Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.</p>
<p class="verse">I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.</p>
<p class="verse">For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds.</p>
<p class="verse">Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth;</p>
<p class="verse">That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me.</p>
<p class="verse">God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.</p>
<p class="verse">Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;</p>
<p class="verse">Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph.</p>
<p class="verse">Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?</p>
<p class="verse">Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?</p>
<p class="verse">Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.</p>
<p class="verse">Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.</p>

<h3>Chapter 109</h3>
<p class="verse">Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;</p>
<p class="verse">For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.</p>
<p class="verse">They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.</p>
<p class="verse">For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer.</p>
<p class="verse">And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.</p>
<p class="verse">Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.</p>
<p class="verse">When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.</p>
<p class="verse">Let his days be few; and let another take his office.</p>
<p class="verse">Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.</p>
<p class="verse">Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places.</p>
<p class="verse">Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.</p>
<p class="verse">Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.</p>
<p class="verse">Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.</p>
<p class="verse">Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.</p>
<p class="verse">Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.</p>
<p class="verse">As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.</p>
<p class="verse">As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.</p>
<p class="verse">Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.</p>
<p class="verse">Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.</p>
<p class="verse">But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name’s sake: because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.</p>
<p class="verse">For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.</p>
<p class="verse">I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.</p>
<p class="verse">My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.</p>
<p class="verse">I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads.</p>
<p class="verse">Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:</p>
<p class="verse">That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast done it.</p>
<p class="verse">Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.</p>
<p class="verse">Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.</p>
<p class="verse">I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.</p>
<p class="verse">For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul.</p>

<h3>Chapter 110</h3>
<p class="verse">The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.</p>
<p class="verse">Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.</p>
<p class="verse">The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.</p>
<p class="verse">He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.</p>
<p class="verse">He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.</p>

<p class="verse">Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse">The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.</p>
<p class="verse">His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is gracious and full of compassion.</p>
<p class="verse">He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant.</p>
<p class="verse">He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.</p>
<p class="verse">The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure.</p>
<p class="verse">They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.</p>
<p class="verse">He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.</p>

<p class="verse">A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion.</p>
<p class="verse">Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.</p>
<p class="verse">He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his enemies.</p>
<p class="verse">He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.</p>
<p class="verse">The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.</p>

<p class="verse">When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;</p>

<p class="verse">The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.</p>

<p class="verse">My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.</p>
<p class="verse">The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.</p>
<p class="verse">Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.</p>
<p class="verse">I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end.</p>
<p class="verse">I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.</p>

<p class="verse">Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.</p>
<p class="verse">Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: therefore I love thy testimonies.</p>
<p class="verse">My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.</p>

<p class="verse">Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.</p>
<p class="verse">I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.</p>
<p class="verse">It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void thy law.</p>

<p class="verse">Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way.</p>
<p class="verse">Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.</p>
<p class="verse">The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.</p>

<p class="verse">Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.</p>
<p class="verse">Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.</p>
<p class="verse">Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts.</p>
<p class="verse">Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes.</p>
<p class="verse">Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.</p>
<p class="verse">Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments.</p>
<p class="verse">Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful.</p>
<p class="verse">My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.</p>
<p class="verse">Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.</p>
<p class="verse">I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts.</p>
<p class="verse">Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy commandments are my delights.</p>
<p class="verse">The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live.</p>
<p class="verse">I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy statutes.</p>
<p class="verse">I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.</p>
<p class="verse">I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.</p>
<p class="verse">Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word.</p>
<p class="verse">Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD, quicken me according to thy judgment.</p>

<p class="verse">Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law.</p>
<p class="verse">Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word.</p>
<p class="verse">Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes.</p>
<p class="verse">Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to thy judgments.</p>
<p class="verse">Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline from thy testimonies.</p>
<p class="verse">I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word.</p>
<p class="verse">Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD, according to thy lovingkindness.</p>
<p class="verse">Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.</p>
<p class="verse">I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.</p>
<p class="verse">I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.</p>
<p class="verse">Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments.</p>
<p class="verse">Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.</p>
<p class="verse">LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments.</p>
<p class="verse">My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly.</p>
<p class="verse">I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways are before thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me understanding according to thy word.</p>

<p class="verse">My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes.</p>
<p class="verse">My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are righteousness.</p>

<p class="verse">All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they hear the words of thy mouth.</p>

<h3>Chapter 139</h3>
<p class="verse">O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known me.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.</p>
<p class="verse">For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.</p>
<p class="verse">Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.</p>
<p class="verse">Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?</p>
<p class="verse">If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.</p>
<p class="verse">If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;</p>
<p class="verse">Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.</p>
<p class="verse">If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.</p>
<p class="verse">For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother’s womb.</p>
<p class="verse">I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.</p>
<p class="verse">My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.</p>
<p class="verse">How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!</p>
<p class="verse">If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.</p>
<p class="verse">For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.</p>
<p class="verse">Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?</p>
<p class="verse">I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.</p>
<p class="verse">Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:</p>
<p class="verse">And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.</p>
<p class="verse">And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.</p>
<p class="verse">And Elimelech Naomi’s husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.</p>
<p class="verse">And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.</p>
<p class="verse">And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.</p>
<p class="verse">Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother’s house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.</p>
<p class="verse">And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.</p>
<p class="verse">And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?</p>
<p class="verse">Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;</p>
<p class="verse">Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.</p>
<p class="verse">And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.</p>
<p class="verse">And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.</p>
<p class="verse">And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:</p>
<p class="verse">Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.</p>
<p class="verse">When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.</p>
<p class="verse">So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?</p>
<p class="verse">And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.</p>
<p class="verse">I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?</p>
<p class="verse">So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-ruth-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.</p>
<p class="verse">And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.</p>
<p class="verse">And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?</p>
<p class="verse">And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:</p>
<p class="verse">And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:</p>
<p class="verse">Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.</p>
<p class="verse">Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?</p>
<p class="verse">And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.</p>
<p class="verse">Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.</p>
<p class="verse">And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.</p>
<p class="verse">And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:</p>
<p class="verse">And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.</p>
<p class="verse">So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.</p>
<p class="verse">And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.</p>
<p class="verse">And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man’s name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz.</p>
<p class="verse">And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen.</p>
<p class="verse">And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.</p>
<p class="verse">And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.</p>
<p class="verse">So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-ruth-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?</p>
<p class="verse">And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.</p>
<p class="verse">Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.</p>
<p class="verse">And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.</p>
<p class="verse">And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.</p>
<p class="verse">And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman.</p>
<p class="verse">And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.</p>
<p class="verse">Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman’s part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.</p>
<p class="verse">And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor.</p>
<p class="verse">Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.</p>
<p class="verse">And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.</p>
<p class="verse">And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-ruth-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech’s:</p>
<p class="verse">And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse">And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem it.</p>
<p class="verse">Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew off his shoe.</p>
<p class="verse">And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, of the hand of Naomi.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:</p>
<p class="verse">And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.</p>
<p class="verse">So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.</p>
<p class="verse">And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.</p>
<p class="verse">And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.</p>
<p class="verse">Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,</p>
<p class="verse">And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,</p>
<p class="verse">And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,</p>
<p class="verse">And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,</p>
<p class="verse">And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</p>
<p class="verse">My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;</p>
<p class="verse">Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</p>
<p class="verse">But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</p>
<p class="verse">If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</p>
<p class="verse">But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</p>
<p class="verse">For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.</p>
<p class="verse">Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:</p>
<p class="verse">But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</p>
<p class="verse">For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</p>
<p class="verse">Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:</p>
<p class="verse">But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.</p>
<p class="verse">Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</p>
<p class="verse">Do not err, my beloved brethren.</p>
<p class="verse">Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</p>
<p class="verse">Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</p>
<p class="verse">For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</p>
<p class="verse">But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</p>
<p class="verse">For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</p>
<p class="verse">For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</p>
<p class="verse">But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</p>
<p class="verse">If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.</p>
<p class="verse">Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-james-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.</p>
<p class="verse">For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;</p>
<p class="verse">And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:</p>
<p class="verse">Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</p>
<p class="verse">Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?</p>
<p class="verse">But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?</p>
<p class="verse">Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?</p>
<p class="verse">If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:</p>
<p class="verse">But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.</p>
<p class="verse">For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</p>
<p class="verse">For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</p>
<p class="verse">So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</p>
<p class="verse">For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.</p>
<p class="verse">What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?</p>
<p class="verse">If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,</p>
<p class="verse">And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?</p>
<p class="verse">Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</p>
<p class="verse">But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</p>
<p class="verse">Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</p>
<p class="verse">Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?</p>
<p class="verse">And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?</p>
<p class="verse">For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-james-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.</p>
<p class="verse">For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.</p>
<p class="verse">Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!</p>
<p class="verse">And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.</p>
<p class="verse">For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:</p>
<p class="verse">But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.</p>
<p class="verse">Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</p>
<p class="verse">Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?</p>
<p class="verse">Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.</p>
<p class="verse">Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse">But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.</p>
<p class="verse">For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.</p>
<p class="verse">But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.</p>
<p class="verse">And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-james-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?</p>
<p class="verse">Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?</p>
<p class="verse">But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.</p>
<p class="verse">Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</p>
<p class="verse">Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.</p>
<p class="verse">Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.</p>
<p class="verse">Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.</p>
<p class="verse">Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.</p>
<p class="verse">There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?</p>
<p class="verse">Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:</p>
<p class="verse">Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.</p>
<p class="verse">For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.</p>
<p class="verse">But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-james-5">
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you.</p>
<p class="verse">Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.</p>
<p class="verse">Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.</p>
<p class="verse">Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.</p>
<p class="verse">Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.</p>
<p class="verse">Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.</p>
<p class="verse">Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.</p>
<p class="verse">But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.</p>
<p class="verse">Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.</p>
<p class="verse">Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:</p>
<p class="verse">And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.</p>
<p class="verse">Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</p>
<p class="verse">Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.</p>
<p class="verse">And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.</p>
<p class="verse">Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;</p>
<p class="verse">Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,</p>
<p class="verse">Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</p>
<p class="verse">To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,</p>
<p class="verse">Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:</p>
<p class="verse">That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse">Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:</p>
<p class="verse">Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.</p>
<p class="verse">Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:</p>
<p class="verse">Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.</p>
<p class="verse">Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;</p>
<p class="verse">As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:</p>
<p class="verse">But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;</p>
<p class="verse">Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.</p>
<p class="verse">And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man’s work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:</p>
<p class="verse">Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;</p>
<p class="verse">But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:</p>
<p class="verse">Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,</p>
<p class="verse">Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.</p>
<p class="verse">Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently:</p>
<p class="verse">Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:</p>
<p class="verse">But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 peter-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,</p>
<p class="verse">As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:</p>
<p class="verse">If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.</p>
<p class="verse">To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,</p>
<p class="verse">Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.</p>
<p class="verse">Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,</p>
<p class="verse">And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.</p>
<p class="verse">But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:</p>
<p class="verse">Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</p>
<p class="verse">Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;</p>
<p class="verse">Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.</p>
<p class="verse">Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;</p>
<p class="verse">Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.</p>
<p class="verse">For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:</p>
<p class="verse">As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.</p>
<p class="verse">Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.</p>
<p class="verse">For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.</p>
<p class="verse">For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.</p>
<p class="verse">For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:</p>
<p class="verse">Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:</p>
<p class="verse">Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:</p>
<p class="verse">Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.</p>
<p class="verse">For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;</p>
<p class="verse">While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.</p>
<p class="verse">Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;</p>
<p class="verse">But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.</p>
<p class="verse">For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:</p>
<p class="verse">Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.</p>
<p class="verse">Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:</p>
<p class="verse">Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.</p>
<p class="verse">For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:</p>
<p class="verse">Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.</p>
<p class="verse">For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.</p>
<p class="verse">And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?</p>
<p class="verse">But and if ye suffer for righteousness’ sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;</p>
<p class="verse">But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:</p>
<p class="verse">Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.</p>
<p class="verse">For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:</p>
<p class="verse">By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;</p>
<p class="verse">Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.</p>
<p class="verse">The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse">Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;</p>
<p class="verse">That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.</p>
<p class="verse">For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:</p>
<p class="verse">Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:</p>
<p class="verse">Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.</p>
<p class="verse">For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.</p>
<p class="verse">But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.</p>
<p class="verse">And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.</p>
<p class="verse">Use hospitality one to another without grudging.</p>
<p class="verse">As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</p>
<p class="verse">If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:</p>
<p class="verse">But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.</p>
<p class="verse">If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.</p>
<p class="verse">But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men’s matters.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.</p>
<p class="verse">For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?</p>
<p class="verse">And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:</p>
<p class="verse">Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;</p>
<p class="verse">Neither as being lords over God’s heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</p>
<p class="verse">Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:</p>
<p class="verse">Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.</p>
<p class="verse">Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:</p>
<p class="verse">Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.</p>
<p class="verse">But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.</p>
<p class="verse">To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.</p>
<p class="verse">The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son.</p>
<p class="verse">Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>
