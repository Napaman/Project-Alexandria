<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse">But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.</p>
<p class="verse">In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse">Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.</p>
<p class="verse">Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?</p>
<p class="verse">And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:</p>
<p class="verse">Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the kingâ€™s merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</p>
<p class="verse">And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 chronicles-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This is an ordinance for ever to Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And the house which I build is great: for great is our God above all gods.</p>
<p class="verse">But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?</p>
<p class="verse">Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.</p>
<p class="verse">Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants,</p>
<p class="verse">Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build shall be wonderful great.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath made thee king over them.</p>
<p class="verse">Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse">And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my fatherâ€™s,</p>
<p class="verse">The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:</p>
<p class="verse">And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.</p>
<p class="verse">And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 chronicles-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</p>
<p class="verse">And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.</p>
<p class="verse">Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.</p>
<p class="verse">And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.</p>
<p class="verse">And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.</p>
<p class="verse">And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.</p>
<p class="verse">He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the walls.</p>
<p class="verse">And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.</p>
<p class="verse">And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.</p>
<p class="verse">And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work, and overlaid them with gold.</p>
<p class="verse">And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long: one wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.</p>
<p class="verse">And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.</p>
<p class="verse">The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were inward.</p>
<p class="verse">And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.</p>
<p class="verse">Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.</p>
<p class="verse">And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.</p>
<p class="verse">And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 chronicles-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.</p>
<p class="verse">And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast.</p>
<p class="verse">It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.</p>
<p class="verse">And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; and it received and held three thousand baths.</p>
<p class="verse">He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.</p>
<p class="verse">And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.</p>
<p class="verse">He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basons of gold.</p>
<p class="verse">Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.</p>
<p class="verse">And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south.</p>
<p class="verse">And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God;</p>
<p class="verse">To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the top of the pillars;</p>
<p class="verse">And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were upon the pillars.</p>
<p class="verse">He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases;</p>
<p class="verse">One sea, and twelve oxen under it.</p>
<p class="verse">The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass.</p>
<p class="verse">In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread was set;</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;</p>
<p class="verse">And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of gold, and that perfect gold;</p>
<p class="verse">And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers, of pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the house of the temple, were of gold.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 chronicles-5">
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark.</p>
<p class="verse">And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, these did the priests and the Levites bring up.</p>
<p class="verse">Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims:</p>
<p class="verse">For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.</p>
<p class="verse">And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without. And there it is unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse">There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did not then wait by course:</p>
<p class="verse">Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)</p>
<p class="verse">It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the LORD;</p>
<p class="verse">So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 chronicles-6">
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse">Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.</p>
<p class="verse">But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place for thy dwelling for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath with his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father David, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel:</p>
<p class="verse">But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in thine heart:</p>
<p class="verse">Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken: for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, that he made with the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands:</p>
<p class="verse">For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven,</p>
<p class="verse">And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee in the heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and shewest mercy unto thy servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts:</p>
<p class="verse">Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel; yet so that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.</p>
<p class="verse">Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David.</p>
<p class="verse">But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built!</p>
<p class="verse">Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee:</p>
<p class="verse">That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place.</p>
<p class="verse">Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear thou from thy dwelling place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive.</p>
<p class="verse">If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house;</p>
<p class="verse">Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse">And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;</p>
<p class="verse">Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; yet if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them;</p>
<p class="verse">Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse">If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be:</p>
<p class="verse">Then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any man, or of all thy people Israel, when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house:</p>
<p class="verse">Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men:)</p>
<p class="verse">That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people Israel, but is come from a far country for thy great nameâ€™s sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they come and pray in this house;</p>
<p class="verse">Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.</p>
<p class="verse">If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name;</p>
<p class="verse">Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.</p>
<p class="verse">If they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before their enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near;</p>
<p class="verse">Yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly;</p>
<p class="verse">If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name:</p>
<p class="verse">Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.</p>
<p class="verse">O LORD God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember the mercies of David thy servant.</p>

<p class="verse">And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of musick of the LORD, which David the king had made to praise the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever, when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat.</p>
<p class="verse">Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse">And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.</p>
<p class="verse">And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the kingâ€™s house: and all that came into Solomonâ€™s heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice.</p>
<p class="verse">If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;</p>
<p class="verse">If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.</p>
<p class="verse">Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place.</p>
<p class="verse">For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.</p>
<p class="verse">And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments;</p>
<p class="verse">Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;</p>
<p class="verse">Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations.</p>
<p class="verse">And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and unto this house?</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of the LORD, and his own house,</p>
<p class="verse">That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.</p>
<p class="verse">And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath.</p>
<p class="verse">Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether, fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars;</p>
<p class="verse">And Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion.</p>
<p class="verse">As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which were not of Israel,</p>
<p class="verse">But of their children, who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day.</p>
<p class="verse">But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and captains of his chariots and horsemen.</p>
<p class="verse">And these were the chief of king Solomonâ€™s officers, even two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of the LORD hath come.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the altar of the LORD, which he had built before the porch,</p>
<p class="verse">Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.</p>
<p class="verse">And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded.</p>
<p class="verse">And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.</p>
<p class="verse">Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was perfected.</p>
<p class="verse">Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of Edom.</p>
<p class="verse">And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 chronicles-9">
<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
<p class="verse">And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,</p>
<p class="verse">And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.</p>
<p class="verse">And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: for thou exceedest the fame that I heard.</p>
<p class="verse">Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne, to be king for the LORD thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do judgment and justice.</p>
<p class="verse">And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon.</p>
<p class="verse">And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the LORD, and to the kingâ€™s palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;</p>
<p class="verse">Beside that which chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.</p>
<p class="verse">And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target.</p>
<p class="verse">And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.</p>
<p class="verse">And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the sitting place, and two lions standing by the stays:</p>
<p class="verse">And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon.</p>
<p class="verse">For the kingâ€™s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</p>
<p class="verse">And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.</p>
<p class="verse">And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance.</p>
<p class="verse">And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all lands.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.</p>
<p class="verse">And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 chronicles-10">
<h3>Chapter 10</h3>
<p class="verse">And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come to make him king.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard it, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse">And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spake to Rehoboam, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.</p>
<p class="verse">And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?</p>
<p class="verse">And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us?</p>
<p class="verse">And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my fatherâ€™s loins.</p>
<p class="verse">For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</p>
<p class="verse">So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,</p>
<p class="verse">And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</p>
<p class="verse">So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</p>
<p class="verse">And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to thine own house. So all Israel went to their tents.</p>
<p class="verse">But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</p>
<p class="verse">Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. But king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 chronicles-11">
<h3>Chapter 11</h3>
<p class="verse">And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.</p>
<p class="verse">But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing is done of me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam.</p>
<p class="verse">And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,</p>
<p class="verse">And Bethzur, and Shoco, and Adullam,</p>
<p class="verse">And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,</p>
<p class="verse">And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,</p>
<p class="verse">And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin fenced cities.</p>
<p class="verse">And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and wine.</p>
<p class="verse">And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts.</p>
<p class="verse">For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priestâ€™s office unto the LORD:</p>
<p class="verse">And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.</p>
<p class="verse">And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.</p>
<p class="verse">And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;</p>
<p class="verse">Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.</p>
<p class="verse">And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.</p>
<p class="verse">And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and threescore daughters.)</p>
<p class="verse">And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be ruler among his brethren: for he thought to make him king.</p>
<p class="verse">And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he desired many wives.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 chronicles-12">
<h3>Chapter 12</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,</p>
<p class="verse">With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.</p>
<p class="verse">Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.</p>
<p class="verse">So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the kingâ€™s house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</p>
<p class="verse">Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the kingâ€™s house.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah things went well.</p>
<p class="verse">So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his motherâ€™s name was Naamah an Ammonitess.</p>
<p class="verse">And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.</p>
<p class="verse">And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 chronicles-13">
<h3>Chapter 13</h3>
<p class="verse">Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His motherâ€™s name also was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.</p>
<p class="verse">And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valour.</p>
<p class="verse">And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;</p>
<p class="verse">Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?</p>
<p class="verse">Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.</p>
<p class="verse">And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.</p>
<p class="verse">And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye be a great multitude, and there are with you golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.</p>
<p class="verse">Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods.</p>
<p class="verse">But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business:</p>
<p class="verse">And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephrain with the towns thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.</p>
<p class="verse">But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.</p>
<p class="verse">And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 chronicles-14">
<h3>Chapter 14</h3>
<p class="verse">So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.</p>
<p class="verse">And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:</p>
<p class="verse">For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:</p>
<p class="verse">And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</p>
<p class="verse">Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.</p>
<p class="verse">And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.</p>
<p class="verse">And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</p>
<p class="verse">And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.</p>
<p class="verse">So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.</p>
<p class="verse">And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.</p>
<p class="verse">And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.</p>
<p class="verse">They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 chronicles-15">
<h3>Chapter 15</h3>
<p class="verse">And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:</p>
<p class="verse">And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.</p>
<p class="verse">Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.</p>
<p class="verse">But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.</p>
<p class="verse">And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries.</p>
<p class="verse">And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity.</p>
<p class="verse">Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.</p>
<p class="verse">So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.</p>
<p class="verse">And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.</p>
<p class="verse">And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;</p>
<p class="verse">That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.</p>
<p class="verse">And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.</p>
<p class="verse">And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.</p>
<p class="verse">And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.</p>
<p class="verse">But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.</p>
<p class="verse">And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.</p>
<p class="verse">And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.</p>

<h3>Chapter 16</h3>
<p class="verse">In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the kingâ€™s house, and sent to Benhadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.</p>
<p class="verse">And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.</p>
<p class="verse">And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.</p>
<p class="verse">Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand.</p>
<p class="verse">For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.</p>
<p class="verse">And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.</p>
<p class="verse">And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecariesâ€™ art: and they made a very great burning for him.</p>

<h3>Chapter 17</h3>
<p class="verse">And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim;</p>
<p class="verse">But sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honour in abundance.</p>
<p class="verse">And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even to Benhail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, priests.</p>
<p class="verse">And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people.</p>
<p class="verse">And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.</p>
<p class="verse">Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles, and cities of store.</p>
<p class="verse">And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of war, mighty men of valour, were in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand.</p>
<p class="verse">And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand.</p>
<p class="verse">And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto the LORD; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour.</p>
<p class="verse">And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.</p>
<p class="verse">And next him was Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war.</p>
<p class="verse">These waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all Judah.</p>

<h3>Chapter 18</h3>
<p class="verse">Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab.</p>
<p class="verse">And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead.</p>
<p class="verse">And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the kingâ€™s hand.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.</p>
<p class="verse">And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.</p>
<p class="verse">And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.</p>
<p class="verse">And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?</p>
<p class="verse">Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?</p>
<p class="verse">Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.</p>
<p class="verse">Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said, Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do even so.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?</p>
<p class="verse">And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the kingâ€™s son;</p>
<p class="verse">And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.</p>
<p class="verse">And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.</p>
<p class="verse">So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.</p>
<p class="verse">For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.</p>
<p class="verse">And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.</p>
<p class="verse">And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 chronicles-19">
<h3>Chapter 19</h3>
<p class="verse">And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to seek God.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city,</p>
<p class="verse">And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they returned to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.</p>
<p class="verse">And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the LORD, and so wrath come upon you, and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not trespass.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the kingâ€™s matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously, and the LORD shall be with the good.</p>

<h3>Chapter 20</h3>
<p class="verse">It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them other beside the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.</p>
<p class="verse">Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria; and, behold, they be in Hazazontamar, which is Engedi.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the LORD: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court,</p>
<p class="verse">And said, O LORD God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?</p>
<p class="verse">Art not thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever?</p>
<p class="verse">And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">If, when evil cometh upon us, as the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy presence, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry unto thee in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help.</p>
<p class="verse">And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not;</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.</p>
<p class="verse">O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.</p>
<p class="verse">Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation;</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but Godâ€™s.</p>
<p class="verse">To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them: for the LORD will be with you.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD, worshipping the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on high.</p>
<p class="verse">And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.</p>
<p class="verse">For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much.</p>
<p class="verse">And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse">Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies.</p>
<p class="verse">And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his motherâ€™s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.</p>
<p class="verse">And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:</p>
<p class="verse">And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Eziongaber.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish.</p>

<h3>Chapter 21</h3>
<p class="verse">Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse">And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn.</p>
<p class="verse">Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots.</p>
<p class="verse">So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah thereto.</p>
<p class="verse">And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,</p>
<p class="verse">But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy fatherâ€™s house, which were better than thyself:</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods:</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians:</p>
<p class="verse">And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the kingâ€™s house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.</p>
<p class="verse">And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 chronicles-22">
<h3>Chapter 22</h3>
<p class="verse">And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.</p>
<p class="verse">Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His motherâ€™s name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.</p>
<p class="verse">He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction.</p>
<p class="verse">He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.</p>
<p class="verse">And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.</p>
<p class="verse">And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.</p>
<p class="verse">And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse">But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the kingâ€™s sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.</p>
<p class="verse">And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.</p>

<p class="verse">And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the kingâ€™s son shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David.</p>
<p class="verse">This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the doors;</p>
<p class="verse">And a third part shall be at the kingâ€™s house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.</p>
<p class="verse">So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king Davidâ€™s, which were in the house of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about.</p>
<p class="verse">Then they brought out the kingâ€™s son, and put upon him the crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.</p>
<p class="verse">Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD:</p>
<p class="verse">And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the kingâ€™s house, they slew her there.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the LORDâ€™s people.</p>
<p class="verse">Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.</p>
<p class="verse">Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David.</p>
<p class="verse">And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD, that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high gate into the kingâ€™s house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.</p>

<h3>Chapter 24</h3>
<p class="verse">Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His motherâ€™s name also was Zibiah of Beersheba.</p>
<p class="verse">And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?</p>
<p class="verse">For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim.</p>
<p class="verse">And at the kingâ€™s commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.</p>
<p class="verse">Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the kingâ€™s office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the kingâ€™s scribe and the high priestâ€™s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to offer withal, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.</p>
<p class="verse">And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house.</p>
<p class="verse">Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also forsaken you.</p>
<p class="verse">And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The LORD look upon it, and require it.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.</p>
<p class="verse">For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.</p>
<p class="verse">And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.</p>
<p class="verse">Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.</p>

<h3>Chapter 25</h3>
<p class="verse">Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his motherâ€™s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart.</p>
<p class="verse">Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.</p>
<p class="verse">But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.</p>
<p class="verse">He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver.</p>
<p class="verse">But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim.</p>
<p class="verse">But if thou wilt go, do it, be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down.</p>
<p class="verse">And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.</p>
<p class="verse">And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.</p>
<p class="verse">And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces.</p>
<p class="verse">But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.</p>
<p class="verse">Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand?</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto him, Art thou made of the kingâ€™s counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face.</p>
<p class="verse">And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?</p>
<p class="verse">But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of Edom.</p>
<p class="verse">So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent.</p>
<p class="verse">And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the treasures of the kingâ€™s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.</p>
<p class="verse">And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?</p>
<p class="verse">Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.</p>
<p class="verse">And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.</p>

<h3>Chapter 26</h3>
<p class="verse">Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.</p>
<p class="verse">He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His motherâ€™s name also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah did.</p>
<p class="verse">And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper.</p>
<p class="verse">And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.</p>
<p class="verse">And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself exceedingly.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.</p>
<p class="verse">Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the kingâ€™s captains.</p>
<p class="verse">The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred.</p>
<p class="verse">And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.</p>
<p class="verse">And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast stones.</p>
<p class="verse">And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.</p>
<p class="verse">But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense.</p>
<p class="verse">And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men:</p>
<p class="verse">And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honour from the LORD God.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.</p>
<p class="verse">And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD had smitten him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the kingâ€™s house, judging the people of the land.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.</p>
<p class="verse">So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.</p>

<p class="verse">And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Uzziah did: howbeit he entered not into the temple of the LORD. And the people did yet corruptly.</p>
<p class="verse">He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.</p>
<p class="verse">He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third.</p>

<h3>Chapter 28</h3>
<p class="verse">Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father:</p>
<p class="verse">For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.</p>
<p class="verse">For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the kingâ€™s son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king.</p>
<p class="verse">And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.</p>
<p class="verse">But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God?</p>
<p class="verse">Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you.</p>
<p class="verse">Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,</p>
<p class="verse">And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the LORD already, ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse">And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.</p>
<p class="verse">At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him.</p>
<p class="verse">For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.</p>
<p class="verse">The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelt there.</p>
<p class="verse">For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.</p>
<p class="verse">For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not.</p>
<p class="verse">And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the LORD: this is that king Ahaz.</p>
<p class="verse">For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</p>

<p class="verse">He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them.</p>
<p class="verse">And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the east street,</p>
<p class="verse">And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.</p>
<p class="verse">For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their backs.</p>
<p class="verse">Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes.</p>
<p class="verse">For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.</p>
<p class="verse">Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.</p>
<p class="verse">My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto him, and burn incense.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah:</p>

<p class="verse">And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.</p>
<p class="verse">And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad into the brook Kidron.</p>
<p class="verse">Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.</p>
<p class="verse">Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the vessels thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they are before the altar of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar.</p>
<p class="verse">And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:</p>
<p class="verse">And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the kingâ€™s seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.</p>
<p class="verse">And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began also with the trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.</p>
<p class="verse">And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.</p>
<p class="verse">But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the other priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.</p>
<p class="verse">And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.</p>
<p class="verse">And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 chronicles-30">
<h3>Chapter 30</h3>
<p class="verse">And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.</p>
<p class="verse">For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse">So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written.</p>
<p class="verse">So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.</p>
<p class="verse">And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.</p>
<p class="verse">Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.</p>
<p class="verse">For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him.</p>
<p class="verse">So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.</p>
<p class="verse">And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.</p>
<p class="verse">Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites.</p>
<p class="verse">For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one</p>
<p class="verse">That prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</p>
<p class="verse">And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept other seven days with gladness.</p>
<p class="verse">For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.</p>
<p class="verse">So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place, even unto heaven.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 chronicles-31">
<h3>Chapter 31</h3>
<p class="verse">Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.</p>
<p class="verse">And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">He appointed also the kingâ€™s portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.</p>
<p class="verse">And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps.</p>
<p class="verse">In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD, and his people Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.</p>
<p class="verse">And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared them,</p>
<p class="verse">And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was the next.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things.</p>
<p class="verse">And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their set office, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small:</p>
<p class="verse">Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even unto every one that entereth into the house of the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses;</p>
<p class="verse">Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses;</p>
<p class="verse">And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness:</p>
<p class="verse">Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, which were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city, the men that were expressed by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the Levites.</p>
<p class="verse">And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that which was good and right and truth before the LORD his God.</p>
<p class="verse">And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 chronicles-32">
<h3>Chapter 32</h3>
<p class="verse">After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,</p>
<p class="verse">He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they did help him.</p>
<p class="verse">So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?</p>
<p class="verse">Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.</p>
<p class="verse">And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there be more with us than with him:</p>
<p class="verse">With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?</p>
<p class="verse">Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</p>
<p class="verse">Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?</p>
<p class="verse">Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand?</p>
<p class="verse">Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand?</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?</p>
<p class="verse">And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah.</p>
<p class="verse">He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand.</p>
<p class="verse">Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jewsâ€™ speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.</p>
<p class="verse">And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man.</p>
<p class="verse">And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all other, and guided them on every side.</p>
<p class="verse">And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.</p>
<p class="verse">In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.</p>
<p class="verse">But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.</p>
<p class="verse">And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;</p>
<p class="verse">Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.</p>
<p class="verse">This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 chronicles-33">
<h3>Chapter 33</h3>
<p class="verse">Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:</p>
<p class="verse">But did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, like unto the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.</p>
<p class="verse">Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.</p>
<p class="verse">And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:</p>
<p class="verse">Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.</p>
<p class="verse">So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, and to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not hearken.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,</p>
<p class="verse">And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God.</p>
<p class="verse">Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.</p>
<p class="verse">And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet unto the LORD their God only.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his sins, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers.</p>
<p class="verse">So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse">Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them;</p>
<p class="verse">And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.</p>
<p class="verse">And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house.</p>
<p class="verse">But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 chronicles-34">
<h3>Chapter 34</h3>
<p class="verse">Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.</p>
<p class="verse">And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the right hand, nor to the left.</p>
<p class="verse">For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.</p>
<p class="verse">And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and amend the house:</p>
<p class="verse">Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse">And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and other of the Levites, all that could skill of instruments of musick.</p>
<p class="verse">Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses.</p>
<p class="verse">And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.</p>
<p class="verse">And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do it.</p>
<p class="verse">And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the kingâ€™s, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.</p>
<p class="verse">And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that effect.</p>
<p class="verse">And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me,</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah:</p>
<p class="verse">Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.</p>
<p class="verse">And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard;</p>
<p class="verse">Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.</p>
<p class="verse">And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</p>
<p class="verse">And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.</p>

<h3>Chapter 35</h3>
<p class="verse">Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.</p>
<p class="verse">And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD,</p>
<p class="verse">And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel,</p>
<p class="verse">And prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.</p>
<p class="verse">And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after the division of the families of the Levites.</p>
<p class="verse">So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</p>
<p class="verse">And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the kingâ€™s substance.</p>
<p class="verse">And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle, and three hundred oxen.</p>
<p class="verse">Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen.</p>
<p class="verse">So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the kingâ€™s commandment.</p>
<p class="verse">And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.</p>
<p class="verse">And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.</p>
<p class="verse">And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all the people.</p>
<p class="verse">And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.</p>
<p class="verse">And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the kingâ€™s seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.</p>
<p class="verse">So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.</p>
<p class="verse">And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.</p>
<p class="verse">And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.</p>
<p class="verse">After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.</p>
<p class="verse">But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that he destroy thee not.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.</p>
<p class="verse">And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.</p>
<p class="verse">His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to that which was written in the law of the LORD,</p>
<p class="verse">And his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 chronicles-36">
<h3>Chapter 36</h3>
<p class="verse">Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his fatherâ€™s stead in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse">Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God.</p>
<p class="verse">Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse">Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse">Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the LORD God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:</p>
<p class="verse">But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till there was no remedy.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age: he gave them all into his hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse">And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:</p>
<p class="verse">To fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.</p>
<p class="verse">Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of all his people? The LORD his God be with him, and let him go up.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the kingâ€™s seed, and of the princes;</p>
<p class="verse">Children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the kingâ€™s palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king appointed them a daily provision of the kingâ€™s meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</p>
<p class="verse">Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</p>
<p class="verse">Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.</p>
<p class="verse">But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the kingâ€™s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</p>
<p class="verse">Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.</p>
<p class="verse">And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</p>
<p class="verse">Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.</p>
<p class="verse">Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the kingâ€™s meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.</p>
<p class="verse">So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</p>
<p class="verse">And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the kingâ€™s meat.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.</p>
<p class="verse">As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</p>
<p class="verse">Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.</p>
<p class="verse">And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.</p>
<p class="verse">And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-daniel-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.</p>
<p class="verse">Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.</p>
<p class="verse">The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</p>
<p class="verse">But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.</p>
<p class="verse">The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.</p>
<p class="verse">But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the kingâ€™s matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.</p>
<p class="verse">And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</p>
<p class="verse">For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse">And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the kingâ€™s guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:</p>
<p class="verse">He answered and said to Arioch the kingâ€™s captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:</p>
<p class="verse">That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse">Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:</p>
<p class="verse">And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:</p>
<p class="verse">He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.</p>
<p class="verse">I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the kingâ€™s matter.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.</p>
<p class="verse">The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?</p>
<p class="verse">Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;</p>
<p class="verse">But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;</p>
<p class="verse">As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.</p>
<p class="verse">But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible.</p>
<p class="verse">This imageâ€™s head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,</p>
<p class="verse">His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.</p>
<p class="verse">Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</p>
<p class="verse">This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.</p>
<p class="verse">And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold.</p>
<p class="verse">And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.</p>
<p class="verse">And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of pottersâ€™ clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.</p>
<p class="verse">And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</p>
<p class="verse">And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</p>
<p class="verse">And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.</p>
<p class="verse">The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-daniel-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</p>
<p class="verse">Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,</p>
<p class="verse">That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:</p>
<p class="verse">And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse">They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image:</p>
<p class="verse">And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</p>
<p class="verse">There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.</p>
<p class="verse">Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</p>
<p class="verse">Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?</p>
<p class="verse">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.</p>
<p class="verse">If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.</p>
<p class="verse">But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</p>
<p class="verse">Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</p>
<p class="verse">And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</p>
<p class="verse">Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore because the kingâ€™s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</p>
<p class="verse">And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.</p>
<p class="verse">He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire.</p>
<p class="verse">And the princes, governors, and captains, and the kingâ€™s counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the kingâ€™s word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-daniel-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me.</p>
<p class="verse">How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.</p>
<p class="verse">I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace:</p>
<p class="verse">I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.</p>
<p class="verse">Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my God, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great.</p>
<p class="verse">The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth:</p>
<p class="verse">The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.</p>
<p class="verse">I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;</p>
<p class="verse">He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:</p>
<p class="verse">Let his heart be changed from manâ€™s, and let a beastâ€™s heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.</p>
<p class="verse">This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.</p>
<p class="verse">This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies.</p>
<p class="verse">The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;</p>
<p class="verse">Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:</p>
<p class="verse">It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;</p>
<p class="verse">This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:</p>
<p class="verse">That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</p>
<p class="verse">And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.</p>
<p class="verse">All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
<p class="verse">At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse">The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?</p>
<p class="verse">While the word was in the kingâ€™s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</p>
<p class="verse">The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eaglesâ€™ feathers, and his nails like birdsâ€™ claws.</p>
<p class="verse">And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:</p>
<p class="verse">And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?</p>
<p class="verse">At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me.</p>
<p class="verse">Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.</p>
<p class="verse">Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.</p>
<p class="verse">Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.</p>
<p class="verse">They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.</p>
<p class="verse">In the same hour came forth fingers of a manâ€™s hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the kingâ€™s palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the kingâ€™s countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.</p>
<p class="verse">The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse">Then came in all the kingâ€™s wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed:</p>
<p class="verse">There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;</p>
<p class="verse">Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.</p>
<p class="verse">Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry?</p>
<p class="verse">I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing:</p>
<p class="verse">And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.</p>
<p class="verse">O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:</p>
<p class="verse">And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.</p>
<p class="verse">But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:</p>
<p class="verse">And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.</p>
<p class="verse">And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this;</p>
<p class="verse">But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:</p>
<p class="verse">Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.</p>
<p class="verse">And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.</p>
<p class="verse">This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.</p>
<p class="verse">TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.</p>
<p class="verse">PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.</p>
<p class="verse">Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse">In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.</p>
<p class="verse">And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-daniel-6">
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse">It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;</p>
<p class="verse">And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage.</p>
<p class="verse">Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.</p>
<p class="verse">Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.</p>
<p class="verse">Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.</p>
<p class="verse">Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.</p>
<p class="verse">Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.</p>
<p class="verse">Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the kingâ€™s decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.</p>
<p class="verse">Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lionsâ€™ mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.</p>
<p class="verse">Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den.</p>
<p class="verse">Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end.</p>
<p class="verse">He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.</p>
<p class="verse">So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-daniel-7">
<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="verse">In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters.</p>
<p class="verse">Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.</p>
<p class="verse">And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.</p>
<p class="verse">The first was like a lion, and had eagleâ€™s wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a manâ€™s heart was given to it.</p>
<p class="verse">And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.</p>
<p class="verse">After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.</p>
<p class="verse">After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</p>
<p class="verse">I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.</p>
<p class="verse">I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.</p>
<p class="verse">A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</p>
<p class="verse">I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.</p>
<p class="verse">As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.</p>
<p class="verse">I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</p>
<p class="verse">And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse">I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</p>
<p class="verse">I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.</p>
<p class="verse">These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.</p>
<p class="verse">Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;</p>
<p class="verse">And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.</p>
<p class="verse">I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;</p>
<p class="verse">Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</p>
<p class="verse">And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.</p>
<p class="verse">But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.</p>
<p class="verse">And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.</p>
<p class="verse">Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-daniel-8">
<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="verse">In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.</p>
<p class="verse">And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.</p>
<p class="verse">Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</p>
<p class="verse">I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.</p>
<p class="verse">And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</p>
<p class="verse">And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.</p>
<p class="verse">And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.</p>
<p class="verse">And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</p>
<p class="verse">And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.</p>
<p class="verse">Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.</p>
<p class="verse">And I heard a manâ€™s voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.</p>
<p class="verse">So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.</p>
<p class="verse">Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.</p>
<p class="verse">The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.</p>
<p class="verse">And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.</p>
<p class="verse">Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.</p>
<p class="verse">And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.</p>
<p class="verse">And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.</p>
<p class="verse">And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days.</p>
<p class="verse">And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the kingâ€™s business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it.</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
<p class="verse">In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;</p>
<p class="verse">In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:</p>
<p class="verse">And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;</p>
<p class="verse">We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:</p>
<p class="verse">Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.</p>
<p class="verse">O LORD, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.</p>
<p class="verse">O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.</p>
<p class="verse">To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him;</p>
<p class="verse">Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice.</p>
<p class="verse">And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.</p>
<p class="verse">O LORD, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lordâ€™s sake.</p>
<p class="verse">O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.</p>
<p class="verse">O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name.</p>
<p class="verse">And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God;</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.</p>
<p class="verse">And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding.</p>
<p class="verse">At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to shew thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision.</p>
<p class="verse">Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.</p>
<p class="verse">Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.</p>
<p class="verse">And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.</p>

<h3>Chapter 10</h3>
<p class="verse">In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.</p>
<p class="verse">In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.</p>
<p class="verse">I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.</p>
<p class="verse">And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel;</p>
<p class="verse">Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz:</p>
<p class="verse">His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.</p>
<p class="verse">And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.</p>
<p class="verse">But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.</p>
<p class="verse">Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.</p>
<p class="verse">For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.</p>
<p class="verse">Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,</p>
<p class="verse">And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.</p>
<p class="verse">But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince.</p>

<h3>Chapter 11</h3>
<p class="verse">Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him.</p>
<p class="verse">And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.</p>
<p class="verse">And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.</p>
<p class="verse">And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the kingâ€™s daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.</p>
<p class="verse">But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:</p>
<p class="verse">And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north.</p>
<p class="verse">So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall return into his own land.</p>
<p class="verse">But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened by it.</p>
<p class="verse">For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches.</p>
<p class="verse">And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.</p>
<p class="verse">So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to withstand.</p>
<p class="verse">But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.</p>
<p class="verse">He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him.</p>
<p class="verse">After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.</p>
<p class="verse">Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.</p>
<p class="verse">And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.</p>
<p class="verse">And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.</p>
<p class="verse">And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.</p>
<p class="verse">He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathersâ€™ fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.</p>
<p class="verse">And both these kingsâ€™ hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.</p>
<p class="verse">Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits, and return to his own land.</p>
<p class="verse">At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.</p>
<p class="verse">For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.</p>
<p class="verse">And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.</p>
<p class="verse">And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.</p>
<p class="verse">And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many days.</p>
<p class="verse">Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.</p>
<p class="verse">And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.</p>
<p class="verse">Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.</p>
<p class="verse">But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.</p>
<p class="verse">And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.</p>
<p class="verse">He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.</p>
<p class="verse">He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape.</p>
<p class="verse">But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.</p>
<p class="verse">But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.</p>

<h3>Chapter 12</h3>
<p class="verse">And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.</p>
<p class="verse">And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.</p>
<p class="verse">And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.</p>
<p class="verse">But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.</p>
<p class="verse">Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river.</p>
<p class="verse">And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?</p>
<p class="verse">And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.</p>
<p class="verse">And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things?</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end.</p>
<p class="verse">Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.</p>
<p class="verse">And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.</p>
<p class="verse">But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days.</p>

<p class="verse">The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:</p>
<p class="verse">But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces of Benhadad.</p>
<p class="verse">I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom:</p>
<p class="verse">But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour the palaces thereof:</p>
<p class="verse">And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon, and I will turn mine hand against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant:</p>
<p class="verse">But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus, which shall devour the palaces thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever:</p>
<p class="verse">But I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they might enlarge their border:</p>
<p class="verse">But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind:</p>
<p class="verse">And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, saith the LORD.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:</p>

<p class="verse">And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked:</p>
<p class="verse">But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;</p>
<p class="verse">That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the same maid, to profane my holy name:</p>
<p class="verse">And they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.</p>
<p class="verse">Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.</p>
<p class="verse">And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself:</p>
<p class="verse">Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.</p>
<p class="verse">Can two walk together, except they be agreed?</p>
<p class="verse">Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?</p>
<p class="verse">Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin is for him? shall one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all?</p>
<p class="verse">Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done it?</p>
<p class="verse">Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse">The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD hath spoken, who can but prophesy?</p>
<p class="verse">Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof, and the oppressed in the midst thereof.</p>
<p class="verse">For they know not to do right, saith the LORD, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; An adversary there shall be even round about the land; and he shall bring down thy strength from thee, and thy palaces shall be spoiled.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the LORD; As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus in a couch.</p>
<p class="verse">Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord GOD, the God of hosts,</p>
<p class="verse">That in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of Bethel: and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, saith the LORD.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink.</p>
<p class="verse">The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall go out at the breaches, every cow at that which is before her; and ye shall cast them into the palace, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes after three years:</p>
<p class="verse">And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim and publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="verse">And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And also I have withholden the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.</p>
<p class="verse">So two or three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the palmerworm devoured them: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: and because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name.</p>

<p class="verse">For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live:</p>
<p class="verse">But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nought.</p>
<p class="verse">Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Bethel.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,</p>
<p class="verse">Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name:</p>
<p class="verse">That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.</p>
<p class="verse">They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.</p>
<p class="verse">Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.</p>
<p class="verse">For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an evil time.</p>
<p class="verse">Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.</p>
<p class="verse">Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD, saith thus; Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.</p>
<p class="verse">And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through thee, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.</p>
<p class="verse">As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.</p>
<p class="verse">Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?</p>
<p class="verse">I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.</p>
<p class="verse">Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.</p>
<p class="verse">Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.</p>
<p class="verse">But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.</p>
<p class="verse">Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?</p>
<p class="verse">But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts.</p>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse">Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, which are named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came!</p>
<p class="verse">Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?</p>
<p class="verse">Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;</p>
<p class="verse">That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;</p>
<p class="verse">That chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves instruments of musick, like David;</p>
<p class="verse">That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed.</p>
<p class="verse">The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die.</p>
<p class="verse">And a manâ€™s uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with thee? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">For, behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.</p>
<p class="verse">Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plow there with oxen? for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock:</p>
<p class="verse">Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?</p>
<p class="verse">But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hemath unto the river of the wilderness.</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="verse">Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the kingâ€™s mowings.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the LORD stood upon a wall made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the LORD, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:</p>
<p class="verse">And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</p>
<p class="verse">For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.</p>
<p class="verse">Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:</p>
<p class="verse">But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the kingâ€™s chapel, and it is the kingâ€™s court.</p>
<p class="verse">Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophetâ€™s son; but I was an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.</p>
</div>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="verse">Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and behold a basket of summer fruit.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said the LORD unto me, The end is come upon my people of Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.</p>
<p class="verse">And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith the Lord GOD: there shall be many dead bodies in every place; they shall cast them forth with silence.</p>
<p class="verse">Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?</p>
<p class="verse">That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; yea, and sell the refuse of the wheat?</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.</p>
<p class="verse">Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall be cast out and drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord GOD, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day:</p>
<p class="verse">And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find it.</p>
<p class="verse">In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst.</p>
<p class="verse">They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O Dan, liveth; and, The manner of Beersheba liveth; even they shall fall, and never rise up again.</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
<p class="verse">I saw the LORD standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered.</p>
<p class="verse">Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down:</p>
<p class="verse">And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them:</p>
<p class="verse">And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Lord GOD of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise up wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse">It is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name.</p>
<p class="verse">Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say, The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us.</p>
<p class="verse">In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old:</p>
<p class="verse">That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, which are called by my name, saith the LORD that doeth this.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith the LORD thy God.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 timothy-1">
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;</p>
<p class="verse">Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,</p>
<p class="verse">Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:</p>
<p class="verse">From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;</p>
<p class="verse">Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</p>
<p class="verse">But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;</p>
<p class="verse">Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</p>
<p class="verse">For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;</p>
<p class="verse">According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</p>
<p class="verse">And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;</p>
<p class="verse">Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</p>
<p class="verse">And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.</p>
<p class="verse">Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;</p>
<p class="verse">Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:</p>
<p class="verse">Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 timothy-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;</p>
<p class="verse">For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.</p>
<p class="verse">For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;</p>
<p class="verse">Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;</p>
<p class="verse">Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.</p>
<p class="verse">Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.</p>
<p class="verse">I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.</p>
<p class="verse">In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;</p>
<p class="verse">But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.</p>
<p class="verse">Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.</p>
<p class="verse">But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.</p>
<p class="verse">For Adam was first formed, then Eve.</p>
<p class="verse">And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.</p>
<p class="verse">Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 timothy-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.</p>
<p class="verse">A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;</p>
<p class="verse">Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;</p>
<p class="verse">One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;</p>
<p class="verse">(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)</p>
<p class="verse">Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;</p>
<p class="verse">Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</p>
<p class="verse">And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless.</p>
<p class="verse">Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.</p>
<p class="verse">Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.</p>
<p class="verse">For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:</p>
<p class="verse">But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 timothy-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;</p>
<p class="verse">Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;</p>
<p class="verse">Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:</p>
<p class="verse">For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</p>
<p class="verse">If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.</p>
<p class="verse">But refuse profane and old wivesâ€™ fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness.</p>
<p class="verse">For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</p>
<p class="verse">This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.</p>
<p class="verse">For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.</p>
<p class="verse">These things command and teach.</p>
<p class="verse">Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</p>
<p class="verse">Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse">Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.</p>
<p class="verse">Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.</p>
<p class="verse">Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 timothy-5">
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;</p>
<p class="verse">The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.</p>
<p class="verse">Honour widows that are widows indeed.</p>
<p class="verse">But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.</p>
<p class="verse">Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.</p>
<p class="verse">But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.</p>
<p class="verse">And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.</p>
<p class="verse">But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.</p>
<p class="verse">Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man,</p>
<p class="verse">Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saintsâ€™ feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.</p>
<p class="verse">But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;</p>
<p class="verse">Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.</p>
<p class="verse">And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.</p>
<p class="verse">I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.</p>
<p class="verse">For some are already turned aside after Satan.</p>
<p class="verse">If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.</p>
<p class="verse">Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse">For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.</p>
<p class="verse">Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.</p>
<p class="verse">Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.</p>
<p class="verse">I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.</p>
<p class="verse">Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other menâ€™s sins: keep thyself pure.</p>
<p class="verse">Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomachâ€™s sake and thine often infirmities.</p>
<p class="verse">Some menâ€™s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 timothy-6">
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse">Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.</p>
<p class="verse">And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.</p>
<p class="verse">If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;</p>
<p class="verse">He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,</p>
<p class="verse">Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.</p>
<p class="verse">But godliness with contentment is great gain.</p>
<p class="verse">For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.</p>
<p class="verse">And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.</p>
<p class="verse">But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.</p>
<p class="verse">For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</p>
<p class="verse">But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.</p>
<p class="verse">Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.</p>
<p class="verse">I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;</p>
<p class="verse">That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse">Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;</p>
<p class="verse">Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;</p>
<p class="verse">That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;</p>
<p class="verse">Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse">O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:</p>
<p class="verse">Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,</p>
<p class="verse">To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;</p>
<p class="verse">Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</p>
<p class="verse">When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</p>
<p class="verse">For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</p>
<p class="verse">Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;</p>
<p class="verse">Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,</p>
<p class="verse">But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:</p>
<p class="verse">Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="verse">For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.</p>
<p class="verse">Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.</p>
<p class="verse">This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</p>
<p class="verse">The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:</p>
<p class="verse">But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me.</p>
<p class="verse">The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 timothy-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.</p>
<p class="verse">And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</p>
<p class="verse">The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.</p>
<p class="verse">Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</p>
<p class="verse">Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:</p>
<p class="verse">Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore I endure all things for the electâ€™s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</p>
<p class="verse">It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:</p>
<p class="verse">If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:</p>
<p class="verse">If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.</p>
<p class="verse">Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.</p>
<p class="verse">Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</p>
<p class="verse">But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.</p>
<p class="verse">And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</p>
<p class="verse">Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse">But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.</p>
<p class="verse">If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the masterâ€™s use, and prepared unto every good work.</p>
<p class="verse">Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p>
<p class="verse">But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.</p>
<p class="verse">And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,</p>
<p class="verse">In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;</p>
<p class="verse">And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 timothy-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</p>
<p class="verse">For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</p>
<p class="verse">Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</p>
<p class="verse">Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</p>
<p class="verse">Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</p>
<p class="verse">For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,</p>
<p class="verse">Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.</p>
<p class="verse">But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.</p>
<p class="verse">But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,</p>
<p class="verse">Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</p>
<p class="verse">But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</p>
<p class="verse">But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;</p>
<p class="verse">And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</p>
<p class="verse">That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 timothy-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;</p>
<p class="verse">Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse">For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.</p>
<p class="verse">But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.</p>
<p class="verse">For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</p>
<p class="verse">I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:</p>
<p class="verse">Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.</p>
<p class="verse">Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:</p>
<p class="verse">For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.</p>
<p class="verse">Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</p>
<p class="verse">And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.</p>
<p class="verse">The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.</p>
<p class="verse">Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:</p>
<p class="verse">Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.</p>
<p class="verse">At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.</p>
<p class="verse">Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.</p>
<p class="verse">Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.</p>
<p class="verse">Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</p>
<p class="verse">The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of Godâ€™s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</p>
<p class="verse">In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;</p>
<p class="verse">But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</p>
<p class="verse">To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</p>
<p class="verse">For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</p>
<p class="verse">If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.</p>
<p class="verse">For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;</p>
<p class="verse">But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;</p>
<p class="verse">Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</p>
<p class="verse">For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:</p>
<p class="verse">Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucreâ€™s sake.</p>
<p class="verse">One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.</p>
<p class="verse">This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</p>
<p class="verse">Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.</p>
<p class="verse">They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-titus-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:</p>
<p class="verse">That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.</p>
<p class="verse">The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;</p>
<p class="verse">That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,</p>
<p class="verse">To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</p>
<p class="verse">Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.</p>
<p class="verse">In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,</p>
<p class="verse">Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.</p>
<p class="verse">Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;</p>
<p class="verse">Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</p>
<p class="verse">For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,</p>
<p class="verse">Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;</p>
<p class="verse">Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</p>
<p class="verse">Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</p>
<p class="verse">These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-titus-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,</p>
<p class="verse">To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.</p>
<p class="verse">For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</p>
<p class="verse">But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,</p>
<p class="verse">Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</p>
<p class="verse">Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</p>
<p class="verse">That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse">This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</p>
<p class="verse">But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</p>
<p class="verse">A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;</p>
<p class="verse">Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.</p>
<p class="verse">When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.</p>
<p class="verse">Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</p>
<p class="verse">All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.</p>
