<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;</p>
<p class="verse">It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?</p>
<p class="verse">And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.</p>
<p class="verse">He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.</p>
<p class="verse">So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.</p>
<p class="verse">Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:</p>
<p class="verse">And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD’s anointed?</p>
<p class="verse">And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD’s anointed.</p>
<p class="verse">And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:</p>
<p class="verse">(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)</p>
<p class="verse">The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!</p>
<p class="verse">Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.</p>
<p class="verse">From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.</p>
<p class="verse">Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</p>
<p class="verse">How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.</p>
<p class="verse">I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.</p>
<p class="verse">How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 samuel-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.</p>
<p class="verse">So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal’s wife the Carmelite.</p>
<p class="verse">And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</p>
<p class="verse">And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.</p>
<p class="verse">And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.</p>
<p class="verse">And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.</p>
<p class="verse">But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul’s host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;</p>
<p class="verse">And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">Ishbosheth Saul’s son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.</p>
<p class="verse">And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</p>
<p class="verse">And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</p>
<p class="verse">And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.</p>
<p class="verse">And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.</p>
<p class="verse">Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.</p>
<p class="verse">And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow’s side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in Gibeon.</p>
<p class="verse">And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.</p>
<p class="verse">And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.</p>
<p class="verse">And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he answered, I am.</p>
<p class="verse">And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.</p>
<p class="verse">Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.</p>
<p class="verse">And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?</p>
<p class="verse">And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.</p>
<p class="verse">So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.</p>
<p class="verse">And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.</p>
<p class="verse">And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David’s servants nineteen men and Asahel.</p>
<p class="verse">But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner’s men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.</p>
<p class="verse">And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 samuel-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.</p>
<p class="verse">And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;</p>
<p class="verse">And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;</p>
<p class="verse">And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;</p>
<p class="verse">And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David’s wife. These were born to David in Hebron.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father’s concubine?</p>
<p class="verse">Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog’s head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman?</p>
<p class="verse">So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;</p>
<p class="verse">To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.</p>
<p class="verse">And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul’s daughter, when thou comest to see my face.</p>
<p class="verse">And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul’s son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines.</p>
<p class="verse">And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish.</p>
<p class="verse">And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.</p>
<p class="verse">And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you:</p>
<p class="verse">Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.</p>
<p class="verse">And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.</p>
<p class="verse">So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.</p>
<p class="verse">And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.</p>
<p class="verse">When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?</p>
<p class="verse">Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.</p>
<p class="verse">And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:</p>
<p class="verse">Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father’s house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.</p>
<p class="verse">So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.</p>
<p class="verse">And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth?</p>
<p class="verse">Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the people wept again over him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.</p>
<p class="verse">For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?</p>
<p class="verse">And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 samuel-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">And when Saul’s son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.</p>
<p class="verse">And Saul’s son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.)</p>
<p class="verse">And Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.</p>
<p class="verse">And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.</p>
<p class="verse">And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.</p>
<p class="verse">For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night.</p>
<p class="verse">And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.</p>
<p class="verse">And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</p>
<p class="verse">When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:</p>
<p class="verse">How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?</p>
<p class="verse">And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 samuel-5">
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.</p>
<p class="verse">Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.</p>
<p class="verse">In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, that are hated of David’s soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.</p>
<p class="verse">So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.</p>
<p class="verse">And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.</p>
<p class="verse">And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel’s sake.</p>
<p class="verse">And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.</p>
<p class="verse">And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</p>
<p class="verse">Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</p>
<p class="verse">And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.</p>
<p class="verse">But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.</p>
<p class="verse">The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</p>
<p class="verse">And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim.</p>
<p class="verse">And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</p>
<p class="verse">And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.</p>
<p class="verse">And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.</p>
<p class="verse">And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 samuel-6">
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse">Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.</p>
<p class="verse">And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims.</p>
<p class="verse">And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.</p>
<p class="verse">And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.</p>
<p class="verse">And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they came to Nachon’s threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.</p>
<p class="verse">And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.</p>
<p class="verse">And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?</p>
<p class="verse">So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.</p>
<p class="verse">And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his household.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.</p>
<p class="verse">And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.</p>
<p class="verse">So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.</p>
<p class="verse">And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul’s daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.</p>
<p class="verse">And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse">And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed every one to his house.</p>
<p class="verse">Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!</p>
<p class="verse">And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;</p>
<p class="verse">That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.</p>
<p class="verse">And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart; for the LORD is with thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?</p>
<p class="verse">Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.</p>
<p class="verse">In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:</p>
<p class="verse">And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,</p>
<p class="verse">And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house.</p>
<p class="verse">And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse">He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:</p>
<p class="verse">But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</p>
<p class="verse">Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?</p>
<p class="verse">And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant’s house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?</p>
<p class="verse">And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.</p>
<p class="verse">For thy word’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</p>
<p class="verse">And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?</p>
<p class="verse">For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God.</p>
<p class="verse">And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as thou hast said.</p>
<p class="verse">And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.</p>
<p class="verse">For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.</p>

<p class="verse">And after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Methegammah out of the hand of the Philistines.</p>
<p class="verse">And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became David’s servants, and brought gifts.</p>
<p class="verse">David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.</p>
<p class="verse">And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.</p>
<p class="verse">Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.</p>
<p class="verse">And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.</p>
<p class="verse">When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,</p>
<p class="verse">Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:</p>
<p class="verse">Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;</p>
<p class="verse">Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.</p>

<p class="verse">And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David’s servants. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.</p>

<p class="verse">And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?</p>
<p class="verse">And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar.</p>
<p class="verse">Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.</p>
<p class="verse">Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant!</p>
<p class="verse">And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father’s sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.</p>
<p class="verse">And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master’s son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master’s son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master’s son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king’s sons.</p>
<p class="verse">And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth.</p>

<h3>Chapter 10</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.</p>
<p class="verse">And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.</p>
<p class="verse">When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men.</p>
<p class="verse">And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.</p>
<p class="verse">And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.</p>
<p class="verse">When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:</p>
<p class="verse">And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him good.</p>
<p class="verse">And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together.</p>
<p class="verse">And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.</p>
<p class="verse">And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there.</p>
<p class="verse">And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.</p>

<h3>Chapter 11</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king’s house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.</p>
<p class="verse">And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?</p>
<p class="verse">And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.</p>
<p class="verse">And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with child.</p>
<p class="verse">And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king’s house, and there followed him a mess of meat from the king.</p>
<p class="verse">But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey? why then didst thou not go down unto thine house?</p>
<p class="verse">And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.</p>
<p class="verse">And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.</p>
<p class="verse">And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were.</p>
<p class="verse">And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;</p>
<p class="verse">And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king,</p>
<p class="verse">And if so be that the king’s wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?</p>
<p class="verse">Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</p>
<p class="verse">So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab had sent him for.</p>
<p class="verse">And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate.</p>
<p class="verse">And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and some of the king’s servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</p>
<p class="verse">Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 samuel-12">
<h3>Chapter 12</h3>
<p class="verse">And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.</p>
<p class="verse">The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:</p>
<p class="verse">But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.</p>
<p class="verse">And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.</p>
<p class="verse">And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die:</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.</p>
<p class="verse">And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;</p>
<p class="verse">And I gave thee thy master’s house, and thy master’s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.</p>
<p class="verse">For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.</p>
<p class="verse">And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah’s wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.</p>
<p class="verse">David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?</p>
<p class="verse">But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.</p>
<p class="verse">Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?</p>
<p class="verse">But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.</p>
<p class="verse">And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.</p>
<p class="verse">And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.</p>
<p class="verse">And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took their king’s crown from off his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.</p>
<p class="verse">And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.</p>

<h3>Chapter 13</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.</p>
<p class="verse">And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her.</p>
<p class="verse">But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king’s son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.</p>
<p class="verse">So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.</p>
<p class="verse">Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon’s house, and dress him meat.</p>
<p class="verse">So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.</p>
<p class="verse">And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.</p>
<p class="verse">And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.</p>
<p class="verse">And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.</p>
<p class="verse">And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.</p>
<p class="verse">And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.</p>
<p class="verse">Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.</p>
<p class="verse">And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king’s daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.</p>
<p class="verse">And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.</p>
<p class="verse">And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house.</p>
<p class="verse">But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.</p>
<p class="verse">And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king’s sons.</p>
<p class="verse">And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?</p>
<p class="verse">But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.</p>
<p class="verse">Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.</p>
<p class="verse">And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king’s sons, and there is not one of them left.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.</p>
<p class="verse">But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king’s sons come: as thy servant said, so it is.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.</p>
<p class="verse">But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.</p>
<p class="verse">So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.</p>
<p class="verse">And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 samuel-14">
<h3>Chapter 14</h3>
<p class="verse">Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was toward Absalom.</p>
<p class="verse">And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:</p>
<p class="verse">And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.</p>
<p class="verse">And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father’s house: and the king and his throne be guiltless.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said, Whosoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.</p>
<p class="verse">And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished.</p>
<p class="verse">For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.</p>
<p class="verse">For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:</p>
<p class="verse">To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.</p>
<p class="verse">And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.</p>
<p class="verse">So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king’s face.</p>
<p class="verse">But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year’s end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king’s weight.</p>
<p class="verse">And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.</p>
<p class="verse">So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king’s face.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab’s field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?</p>
<p class="verse">And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king’s face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.</p>
<p class="verse">So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 samuel-15">
<h3>Chapter 15</h3>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.</p>
<p class="verse">Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!</p>
<p class="verse">And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.</p>
<p class="verse">And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.</p>
<p class="verse">For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.</p>
<p class="verse">But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.</p>
<p class="verse">And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.</p>
<p class="verse">And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.</p>
<p class="verse">And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king’s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.</p>
<p class="verse">And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.</p>
<p class="verse">Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse">And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation:</p>
<p class="verse">But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.</p>
<p class="verse">The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.</p>
<p class="verse">See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.</p>
<p class="verse">Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.</p>
<p class="verse">And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.</p>
<p class="verse">And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:</p>
<p class="verse">Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:</p>
<p class="verse">But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father’s servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.</p>
<p class="verse">And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king’s house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok’s son, and Jonathan Abiathar’s son; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.</p>
<p class="verse">So Hushai David’s friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 samuel-16">
<h3>Chapter 16</h3>
<p class="verse">And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses be for the king’s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said, And where is thy master’s son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.</p>
<p class="verse">And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.</p>
<p class="verse">And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.</p>
<p class="verse">And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial:</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?</p>
<p class="verse">And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.</p>
<p class="verse">It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.</p>
<p class="verse">And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill’s side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.</p>
<p class="verse">And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.</p>
<p class="verse">And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?</p>
<p class="verse">And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.</p>
<p class="verse">And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father’s presence, so will I be in thy presence.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.</p>
<p class="verse">And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father’s concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.</p>
<p class="verse">So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 samuel-17">
<h3>Chapter 17</h3>
<p class="verse">Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:</p>
<p class="verse">And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only:</p>
<p class="verse">And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.</p>
<p class="verse">And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not; speak thou.</p>
<p class="verse">And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time.</p>
<p class="verse">For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.</p>
<p class="verse">And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.</p>
<p class="verse">So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.</p>
<p class="verse">And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.</p>
<p class="verse">Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.</p>
<p class="verse">Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man’s house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went down.</p>
<p class="verse">And the woman took and spread a covering over the well’s mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Absalom’s servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.</p>
<p class="verse">Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.</p>
<p class="verse">Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man’s son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab’s mother.</p>
<p class="verse">So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,</p>
<p class="verse">Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles, and parched pulse,</p>
<p class="verse">And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 samuel-18">
<h3>Chapter 18</h3>
<p class="verse">And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.</p>
<p class="verse">And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.</p>
<p class="verse">But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.</p>
<p class="verse">So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;</p>
<p class="verse">Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.</p>
<p class="verse">For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.</p>
<p class="verse">And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.</p>
<p class="verse">And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.</p>
<p class="verse">And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.</p>
<p class="verse">And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king’s son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.</p>
<p class="verse">Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.</p>
<p class="verse">And ten young men that bare Joab’s armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.</p>
<p class="verse">And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.</p>
<p class="verse">Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king’s dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom’s place.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.</p>
<p class="verse">And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king’s son is dead.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?</p>
<p class="verse">But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.</p>
<p class="verse">And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.</p>
<p class="verse">And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.</p>
<p class="verse">And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.</p>
<p class="verse">And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.</p>
<p class="verse">And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king’s servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 samuel-19">
<h3>Chapter 19</h3>
<p class="verse">And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.</p>
<p class="verse">And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.</p>
<p class="verse">And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.</p>
<p class="verse">But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!</p>
<p class="verse">And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;</p>
<p class="verse">In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.</p>
<p class="verse">Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.</p>
<p class="verse">And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?</p>
<p class="verse">And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king?</p>
<p class="verse">And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.</p>
<p class="verse">And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return thou, and all thy servants.</p>
<p class="verse">So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse">And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.</p>
<p class="verse">And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.</p>
<p class="verse">And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king’s household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;</p>
<p class="verse">And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.</p>
<p class="verse">For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.</p>
<p class="verse">But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD’s anointed?</p>
<p class="verse">And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?</p>
<p class="verse">And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.</p>
<p class="verse">And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes.</p>
<p class="verse">For all of my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.</p>
<p class="verse">And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house.</p>
<p class="verse">And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse">Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?</p>
<p class="verse">I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?</p>
<p class="verse">Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?</p>
<p class="verse">Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David’s men with him, over Jordan?</p>
<p class="verse">And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king’s cost? or hath he given us any gift?</p>
<p class="verse">And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 samuel-20">
<h3>Chapter 20</h3>
<p class="verse">And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.</p>
<p class="verse">Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be thou here present.</p>
<p class="verse">So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord’s servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.</p>
<p class="verse">And there went out after him Joab’s men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</p>
<p class="verse">When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. And Joab’s garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.</p>
<p class="verse">And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.</p>
<p class="verse">But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab’s hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.</p>
<p class="verse">And one of Joab’s men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab.</p>
<p class="verse">And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.</p>
<p class="verse">When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</p>
<p class="verse">And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.</p>
<p class="verse">And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.</p>
<p class="verse">Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.</p>
<p class="verse">Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.</p>
<p class="verse">I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?</p>
<p class="verse">And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.</p>
<p class="verse">The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.</p>
<p class="verse">Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:</p>
<p class="verse">And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder:</p>
<p class="verse">And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:</p>
<p class="verse">And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 samuel-21">
<h3>Chapter 21</h3>
<p class="verse">Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD?</p>
<p class="verse">And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you.</p>
<p class="verse">And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel,</p>
<p class="verse">Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD did choose. And the king said, I will give them.</p>
<p class="verse">But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORD’s oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.</p>
<p class="verse">But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:</p>
<p class="verse">And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest.</p>
<p class="verse">And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.</p>
<p class="verse">And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:</p>
<p class="verse">And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.</p>
<p class="verse">And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was intreated for the land.</p>
<p class="verse">Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David waxed faint.</p>
<p class="verse">And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.</p>
<p class="verse">But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant.</p>
<p class="verse">And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.</p>
<p class="verse">And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the brother of David slew him.</p>
<p class="verse">These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 samuel-22">
<h3>Chapter 22</h3>
<p class="verse">And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;</p>
<p class="verse">The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.</p>
<p class="verse">I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</p>
<p class="verse">When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;</p>
<p class="verse">The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;</p>
<p class="verse">In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.</p>
<p class="verse">There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</p>
<p class="verse">He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet.</p>
<p class="verse">And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.</p>
<p class="verse">And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies.</p>
<p class="verse">Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.</p>
<p class="verse">And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.</p>
<p class="verse">And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.</p>
<p class="verse">He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;</p>
<p class="verse">He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.</p>
<p class="verse">They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.</p>
<p class="verse">He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</p>
<p class="verse">For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</p>
<p class="verse">For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.</p>
<p class="verse">I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.</p>
<p class="verse">With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.</p>
<p class="verse">With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.</p>
<p class="verse">And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.</p>
<p class="verse">For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.</p>
<p class="verse">For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.</p>
<p class="verse">As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.</p>
<p class="verse">For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God?</p>
<p class="verse">God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.</p>
<p class="verse">He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet: and setteth me upon my high places.</p>
<p class="verse">He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.</p>
<p class="verse">I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.</p>
<p class="verse">And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.</p>
<p class="verse">For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.</p>
<p class="verse">They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.</p>
<p class="verse">Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.</p>
<p class="verse">Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.</p>
<p class="verse">Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.</p>
<p class="verse">It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,</p>
<p class="verse">And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.</p>
<p class="verse">He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 samuel-23">
<h3>Chapter 23</h3>
<p class="verse">Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,</p>
<p class="verse">The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.</p>
<p class="verse">The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.</p>
<p class="verse">Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.</p>
<p class="verse">But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:</p>
<p class="verse">But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.</p>
<p class="verse">These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.</p>
<p class="verse">And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:</p>
<p class="verse">He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.</p>
<p class="verse">And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.</p>
<p class="verse">But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.</p>
<p class="verse">And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.</p>
<p class="verse">And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.</p>
<p class="verse">And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!</p>
<p class="verse">And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.</p>
<p class="verse">And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.</p>
<p class="verse">Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.</p>
<p class="verse">And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:</p>
<p class="verse">And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.</p>
<p class="verse">These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.</p>
<p class="verse">He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his guard.</p>
<p class="verse">Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,</p>
<p class="verse">Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,</p>
<p class="verse">Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,</p>
<p class="verse">Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,</p>
<p class="verse">Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,</p>
<p class="verse">Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,</p>
<p class="verse">Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,</p>
<p class="verse">Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,</p>
<p class="verse">Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,</p>
<p class="verse">Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,</p>
<p class="verse">Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,</p>
<p class="verse">Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,</p>
<p class="verse">Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,</p>
<p class="verse">Zelek the Ammonite, Nahari the Beerothite, armourbearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah,</p>
<p class="verse">Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite,</p>
<p class="verse">Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.</p>

<h3>Chapter 24</h3>
<p class="verse">And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.</p>
<p class="verse">For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people.</p>
<p class="verse">And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?</p>
<p class="verse">Notwithstanding the king’s word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse">And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:</p>
<p class="verse">Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,</p>
<p class="verse">And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even to Beersheba.</p>
<p class="verse">So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</p>
<p class="verse">And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.</p>
<p class="verse">And David’s heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</p>
<p class="verse">For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse">So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days’ pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.</p>
<p class="verse">And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.</p>
<p class="verse">So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.</p>
<p class="verse">And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father’s house.</p>
<p class="verse">And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.</p>
<p class="verse">And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded.</p>
<p class="verse">And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.</p>
<p class="verse">And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</p>
<p class="verse">And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.</p>
<p class="verse">All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</p>
<p class="verse">And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;</p>
<p class="verse">As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>
<p class="verse">The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</p>
<p class="verse">John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.</p>
<p class="verse">And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>
<p class="verse">And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;</p>
<p class="verse">And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</p>
<p class="verse">I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse">And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:</p>
<p class="verse">And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</p>
<p class="verse">And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse">And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.</p>
<p class="verse">Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</p>
<p class="verse">And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.</p>
<p class="verse">Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</p>
<p class="verse">And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.</p>
<p class="verse">And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.</p>
<p class="verse">And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.</p>
<p class="verse">And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.</p>
<p class="verse">And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.</p>
<p class="verse">And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.</p>
<p class="verse">And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse">And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</p>
<p class="verse">But Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.</p>
<p class="verse">And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the city was gathered together at the door.</p>
<p class="verse">And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.</p>
<p class="verse">And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.</p>
<p class="verse">And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.</p>
<p class="verse">And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.</p>
<p class="verse">And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.</p>
<p class="verse">And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.</p>
<p class="verse">And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;</p>
<p class="verse">And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-mark-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house.</p>
<p class="verse">And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.</p>
<p class="verse">When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.</p>
<p class="verse">But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,</p>
<p class="verse">Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?</p>
<p class="verse">And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?</p>
<p class="verse">Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?</p>
<p class="verse">But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)</p>
<p class="verse">I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.</p>
<p class="verse">And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.</p>
<p class="verse">And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.</p>
<p class="verse">And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?</p>
<p class="verse">When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</p>
<p class="verse">And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</p>
<p class="verse">But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</p>
<p class="verse">No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse.</p>
<p class="verse">And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?</p>
<p class="verse">How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-mark-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth.</p>
<p class="verse">And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,</p>
<p class="verse">And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.</p>
<p class="verse">For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.</p>
<p class="verse">And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.</p>
<p class="verse">And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,</p>
<p class="verse">And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:</p>
<p class="verse">And Simon he surnamed Peter;</p>
<p class="verse">And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:</p>
<p class="verse">And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,</p>
<p class="verse">And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.</p>
<p class="verse">And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.</p>
<p class="verse">And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.</p>
<p class="verse">And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.</p>
<p class="verse">And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?</p>
<p class="verse">And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</p>
<p class="verse">And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</p>
<p class="verse">And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.</p>
<p class="verse">No man can enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.</p>
<p class="verse">Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:</p>
<p class="verse">But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation:</p>
<p class="verse">Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.</p>
<p class="verse">There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.</p>
<p class="verse">And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?</p>
<p class="verse">And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!</p>
<p class="verse">For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-mark-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.</p>
<p class="verse">And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,</p>
<p class="verse">Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:</p>
<p class="verse">And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.</p>
<p class="verse">And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:</p>
<p class="verse">But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</p>
<p class="verse">And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</p>
<p class="verse">And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:</p>
<p class="verse">That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?</p>
<p class="verse">The sower soweth the word.</p>
<p class="verse">And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.</p>
<p class="verse">And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;</p>
<p class="verse">And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word’s sake, immediately they are offended.</p>
<p class="verse">And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,</p>
<p class="verse">And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.</p>
<p class="verse">And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?</p>
<p class="verse">For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.</p>
<p class="verse">If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.</p>
<p class="verse">For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</p>
<p class="verse">And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</p>
<p class="verse">For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</p>
<p class="verse">But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?</p>
<p class="verse">It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:</p>
<p class="verse">But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</p>
<p class="verse">And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it.</p>
<p class="verse">But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.</p>
<p class="verse">And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.</p>
<p class="verse">And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.</p>
<p class="verse">And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?</p>
<p class="verse">And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?</p>
<p class="verse">And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,</p>
<p class="verse">Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:</p>
<p class="verse">Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.</p>
<p class="verse">And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.</p>
<p class="verse">But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,</p>
<p class="verse">And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.</p>
<p class="verse">For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.</p>
<p class="verse">And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.</p>
<p class="verse">And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.</p>
<p class="verse">Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.</p>
<p class="verse">And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.</p>
<p class="verse">And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.</p>
<p class="verse">And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.</p>
<p class="verse">And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</p>
<p class="verse">And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.</p>
<p class="verse">And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea.</p>
<p class="verse">And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,</p>
<p class="verse">And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him.</p>
<p class="verse">And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,</p>
<p class="verse">And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,</p>
<p class="verse">When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.</p>
<p class="verse">For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.</p>
<p class="verse">And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?</p>
<p class="verse">And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</p>
<p class="verse">And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.</p>
<p class="verse">But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.</p>
<p class="verse">While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue’s house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?</p>
<p class="verse">As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.</p>
<p class="verse">And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.</p>
<p class="verse">And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.</p>
<p class="verse">And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.</p>
<p class="verse">And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.</p>
<p class="verse">And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-mark-6">
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p class="verse">And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?</p>
<p class="verse">Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.</p>
<p class="verse">And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.</p>
<p class="verse">And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.</p>
<p class="verse">And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;</p>
<p class="verse">And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:</p>
<p class="verse">But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.</p>
<p class="verse">And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.</p>
<p class="verse">And they went out, and preached that men should repent.</p>
<p class="verse">And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.</p>
<p class="verse">And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.</p>
<p class="verse">Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse">But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.</p>
<p class="verse">For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife: for he had married her.</p>
<p class="verse">For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother’s wife.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:</p>
<p class="verse">For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.</p>
<p class="verse">And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;</p>
<p class="verse">And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse">And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.</p>
<p class="verse">And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.</p>
<p class="verse">And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath’s sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.</p>
<p class="verse">And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,</p>
<p class="verse">And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.</p>
<p class="verse">And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.</p>
<p class="verse">And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.</p>
<p class="verse">And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.</p>
<p class="verse">And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:</p>
<p class="verse">Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.</p>
<p class="verse">He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?</p>
<p class="verse">He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.</p>
<p class="verse">And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.</p>
<p class="verse">And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.</p>
<p class="verse">And they did all eat, and were filled.</p>
<p class="verse">And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.</p>
<p class="verse">And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.</p>
<p class="verse">And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.</p>
<p class="verse">And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.</p>
<p class="verse">And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.</p>
<p class="verse">But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:</p>
<p class="verse">For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.</p>
<p class="verse">And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.</p>
<p class="verse">For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,</p>
<p class="verse">And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.</p>
<p class="verse">And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p class="verse">Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.</p>
<p class="verse">For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?</p>
<p class="verse">He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</p>
<p class="verse">Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</p>
<p class="verse">For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.</p>
<p class="verse">For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:</p>
<p class="verse">But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;</p>
<p class="verse">Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:</p>
<p class="verse">There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.</p>
<p class="verse">If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.</p>
<p class="verse">And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;</p>
<p class="verse">Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.</p>
<p class="verse">For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</p>
<p class="verse">Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:</p>
<p class="verse">All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.</p>
<p class="verse">And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid.</p>
<p class="verse">For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:</p>
<p class="verse">The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it unto the dogs.</p>
<p class="verse">And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.</p>
<p class="verse">And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.</p>
<p class="verse">And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.</p>
<p class="verse">And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;</p>
<p class="verse">And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</p>
<p class="verse">And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.</p>
<p class="verse">And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;</p>
<p class="verse">And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-mark-8">
<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="verse">In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them,</p>
<p class="verse">I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:</p>
<p class="verse">And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.</p>
<p class="verse">And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?</p>
<p class="verse">And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.</p>
<p class="verse">And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people.</p>
<p class="verse">And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them.</p>
<p class="verse">So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets.</p>
<p class="verse">And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.</p>
<p class="verse">And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.</p>
<p class="verse">And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.</p>
<p class="verse">And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.</p>
<p class="verse">And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?</p>
<p class="verse">Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?</p>
<p class="verse">When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?</p>
<p class="verse">And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.</p>
<p class="verse">And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.</p>
<p class="verse">After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.</p>
<p class="verse">And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?</p>
<p class="verse">And they answered, John the Baptist: but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse">And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</p>
<p class="verse">And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.</p>
<p class="verse">But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</p>
<p class="verse">For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, the same shall save it.</p>
<p class="verse">For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?</p>
<p class="verse">Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</p>
<p class="verse">Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.</p>
<p class="verse">And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them.</p>
<p class="verse">And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them.</p>
<p class="verse">And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.</p>
<p class="verse">For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.</p>
<p class="verse">And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.</p>
<p class="verse">And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.</p>
<p class="verse">And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead.</p>
<p class="verse">And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean.</p>
<p class="verse">And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come?</p>
<p class="verse">And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.</p>
<p class="verse">But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them.</p>
<p class="verse">And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?</p>
<p class="verse">And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;</p>
<p class="verse">And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not.</p>
<p class="verse">He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.</p>
<p class="verse">And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.</p>
<p class="verse">And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child.</p>
<p class="verse">And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.</p>
<p class="verse">Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.</p>
<p class="verse">And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.</p>
<p class="verse">When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.</p>
<p class="verse">And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.</p>
<p class="verse">And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it.</p>
<p class="verse">For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.</p>
<p class="verse">But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?</p>
<p class="verse">But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest.</p>
<p class="verse">And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,</p>
<p class="verse">Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.</p>
<p class="verse">And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.</p>
<p class="verse">For he that is not against us is on our part.</p>
<p class="verse">For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.</p>
<p class="verse">And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.</p>
<p class="verse">And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:</p>
<p class="verse">Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</p>
<p class="verse">And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:</p>
<p class="verse">Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</p>
<p class="verse">And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:</p>
<p class="verse">Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</p>
<p class="verse">For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.</p>
<p class="verse">Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.</p>

<h3>Chapter 10</h3>
<p class="verse">And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.</p>
<p class="verse">And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?</p>
<p class="verse">And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.</p>
<p class="verse">But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.</p>
<p class="verse">For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;</p>
<p class="verse">And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh.</p>
<p class="verse">What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.</p>
<p class="verse">And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter.</p>
<p class="verse">And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her.</p>
<p class="verse">And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.</p>
<p class="verse">And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.</p>
<p class="verse">But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother. </p>
<p class="verse">And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.</p>
<p class="verse">And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</p>
<p class="verse">And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!</p>
<p class="verse">It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel’s,</p>
<p class="verse">But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse">But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.</p>
<p class="verse">And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,</p>
<p class="verse">Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:</p>
<p class="verse">And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.</p>
<p class="verse">And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?</p>
<p class="verse">They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?</p>
<p class="verse">And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:</p>
<p class="verse">But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.</p>
<p class="verse">But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:</p>
<p class="verse">And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.</p>
<p class="verse">For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</p>
<p class="verse">And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.</p>
<p class="verse">And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.</p>
<p class="verse">And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.</p>

<h3>Chapter 11</h3>
<p class="verse">And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,</p>
<p class="verse">And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.</p>
<p class="verse">And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.</p>
<p class="verse">And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.</p>
<p class="verse">And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?</p>
<p class="verse">And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.</p>
<p class="verse">And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him.</p>
<p class="verse">And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.</p>
<p class="verse">And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.</p>
<p class="verse">And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:</p>
<p class="verse">And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.</p>
<p class="verse">And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;</p>
<p class="verse">And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple.</p>
<p class="verse">And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves.</p>
<p class="verse">And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse">And when even was come, he went out of the city.</p>
<p class="verse">And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.</p>
<p class="verse">And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.</p>
<p class="verse">For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.</p>
<p class="verse">And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.</p>
<p class="verse">But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.</p>
<p class="verse">And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,</p>
<p class="verse">And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</p>
<p class="verse">The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.</p>
<p class="verse">And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?</p>
<p class="verse">But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.</p>
<p class="verse">And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</p>

<h3>Chapter 12</h3>
<p class="verse">And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.</p>
<p class="verse">And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.</p>
<p class="verse">And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.</p>
<p class="verse">And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled.</p>
<p class="verse">And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.</p>
<p class="verse">Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.</p>
<p class="verse">But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be our’s.</p>
<p class="verse">And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.</p>
<p class="verse">What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.</p>
<p class="verse">And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:</p>
<p class="verse">This was the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</p>
<p class="verse">And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.</p>
<p class="verse">And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</p>
<p class="verse">Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it.</p>
<p class="verse">And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar’s.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. And they marvelled at him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man’s brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</p>
<p class="verse">Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.</p>
<p class="verse">And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.</p>
<p class="verse">And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.</p>
<p class="verse">In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?</p>
<p class="verse">For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</p>
<p class="verse">He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.</p>
<p class="verse">And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:</p>
<p class="verse">And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.</p>
<p class="verse">And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.</p>
<p class="verse">And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:</p>
<p class="verse">And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.</p>
<p class="verse">And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?</p>
<p class="verse">For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</p>
<p class="verse">David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,</p>
<p class="verse">And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:</p>
<p class="verse">Which devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.</p>
<p class="verse">And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.</p>
<p class="verse">And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:</p>
<p class="verse">For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.</p>

<h3>Chapter 13</h3>
<p class="verse">And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.</p>
<p class="verse">And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,</p>
<p class="verse">Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you:</p>
<p class="verse">For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.</p>
<p class="verse">And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.</p>
<p class="verse">For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.</p>
<p class="verse">But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.</p>
<p class="verse">And the gospel must first be published among all nations.</p>
<p class="verse">But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse">Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse">And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.</p>
<p class="verse">But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:</p>
<p class="verse">And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house:</p>
<p class="verse">And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.</p>
<p class="verse">But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!</p>
<p class="verse">And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.</p>
<p class="verse">For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.</p>
<p class="verse">And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect’s sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.</p>
<p class="verse">And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not:</p>
<p class="verse">For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.</p>
<p class="verse">But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.</p>
<p class="verse">But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,</p>
<p class="verse">And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.</p>
<p class="verse">And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.</p>
<p class="verse">And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:</p>
<p class="verse">So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors.</p>
<p class="verse">Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.</p>
<p class="verse">Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.</p>
<p class="verse">But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.</p>
<p class="verse">Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.</p>
<p class="verse">For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.</p>
<p class="verse">Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:</p>
<p class="verse">Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.</p>
<p class="verse">And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.</p>

<h3>Chapter 14</h3>
<p class="verse">After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death.</p>
<p class="verse">But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people.</p>
<p class="verse">And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his head.</p>
<p class="verse">And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?</p>
<p class="verse">For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.</p>
<p class="verse">For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.</p>
<p class="verse">She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.</p>
<p class="verse">Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.</p>
<p class="verse">And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.</p>
<p class="verse">And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?</p>
<p class="verse">And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.</p>
<p class="verse">And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?</p>
<p class="verse">And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.</p>
<p class="verse">And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.</p>
<p class="verse">And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.</p>
<p class="verse">And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.</p>
<p class="verse">And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?</p>
<p class="verse">And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.</p>
<p class="verse">The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.</p>
<p class="verse">And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.</p>
<p class="verse">And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.</p>
<p class="verse">Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.</p>
<p class="verse">But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse">But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.</p>
<p class="verse">But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.</p>
<p class="verse">And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.</p>
<p class="verse">And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;</p>
<p class="verse">And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.</p>
<p class="verse">And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.</p>
<p class="verse">And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?</p>
<p class="verse">Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.</p>
<p class="verse">And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.</p>
<p class="verse">And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</p>
<p class="verse">Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.</p>
<p class="verse">And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.</p>
<p class="verse">And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.</p>
<p class="verse">And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.</p>
<p class="verse">And they laid their hands on him, and took him.</p>
<p class="verse">And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?</p>
<p class="verse">I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="verse">And they all forsook him, and fled.</p>
<p class="verse">And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:</p>
<p class="verse">And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.</p>
<p class="verse">And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.</p>
<p class="verse">And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.</p>
<p class="verse">And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.</p>
<p class="verse">For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.</p>
<p class="verse">And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,</p>
<p class="verse">We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.</p>
<p class="verse">But neither so did their witness agree together.</p>
<p class="verse">And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</p>
<p class="verse">But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse">Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?</p>
<p class="verse">Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.</p>
<p class="verse">And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.</p>
<p class="verse">And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:</p>
<p class="verse">And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p class="verse">But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.</p>
<p class="verse">And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.</p>
<p class="verse">And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.</p>
<p class="verse">But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.</p>
<p class="verse">And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-mark-15">
<h3>Chapter 15</h3>
<p class="verse">And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.</p>
<p class="verse">And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest it.</p>
<p class="verse">And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.</p>
<p class="verse">And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.</p>
<p class="verse">But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.</p>
<p class="verse">Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.</p>
<p class="verse">And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</p>
<p class="verse">And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</p>
<p class="verse">For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.</p>
<p class="verse">But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</p>
<p class="verse">And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?</p>
<p class="verse">And they cried out again, Crucify him.</p>
<p class="verse">Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</p>
<p class="verse">And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</p>
<p class="verse">And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.</p>
<p class="verse">And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,</p>
<p class="verse">And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</p>
<p class="verse">And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.</p>
<p class="verse">And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.</p>
<p class="verse">And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.</p>
<p class="verse">And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.</p>
<p class="verse">And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.</p>
<p class="verse">And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</p>
<p class="verse">And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p class="verse">And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.</p>
<p class="verse">And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.</p>
<p class="verse">And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,</p>
<p class="verse">Save thyself, and come down from the cross.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</p>
<p class="verse">Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</p>
<p class="verse">And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</p>
<p class="verse">And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.</p>
<p class="verse">And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.</p>
<p class="verse">And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.</p>
<p class="verse">And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse">There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</p>
<p class="verse">(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse">And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,</p>
<p class="verse">Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.</p>
<p class="verse">And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</p>
<p class="verse">And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.</p>
<p class="verse">And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-mark-16">
<h3>Chapter 16</h3>
<p class="verse">And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.</p>
<p class="verse">And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.</p>
<p class="verse">And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?</p>
<p class="verse">And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.</p>
<p class="verse">And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.</p>
<p class="verse">And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.</p>
<p class="verse">But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.</p>
<p class="verse">Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.</p>
<p class="verse">And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</p>
<p class="verse">And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.</p>
<p class="verse">After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.</p>
<p class="verse">And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them.</p>
<p class="verse">Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.</p>
<p class="verse">And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.</p>
<p class="verse">He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.</p>
<p class="verse">And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;</p>
<p class="verse">They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.</p>
<p class="verse">So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.</p>
<p class="verse">And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</p>
<p class="verse">My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;</p>
<p class="verse">Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</p>
<p class="verse">But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</p>
<p class="verse">If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</p>
<p class="verse">But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</p>
<p class="verse">For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.</p>
<p class="verse">Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:</p>
<p class="verse">But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</p>
<p class="verse">For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</p>
<p class="verse">Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:</p>
<p class="verse">But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.</p>
<p class="verse">Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</p>
<p class="verse">Do not err, my beloved brethren.</p>
<p class="verse">Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</p>
<p class="verse">Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</p>
<p class="verse">For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</p>
<p class="verse">But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</p>
<p class="verse">For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</p>
<p class="verse">For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</p>
<p class="verse">But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</p>
<p class="verse">If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.</p>
<p class="verse">Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-james-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.</p>
<p class="verse">For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;</p>
<p class="verse">And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:</p>
<p class="verse">Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</p>
<p class="verse">Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?</p>
<p class="verse">But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?</p>
<p class="verse">Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?</p>
<p class="verse">If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:</p>
<p class="verse">But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.</p>
<p class="verse">For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</p>
<p class="verse">For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</p>
<p class="verse">So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</p>
<p class="verse">For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.</p>
<p class="verse">What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?</p>
<p class="verse">If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,</p>
<p class="verse">And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?</p>
<p class="verse">Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</p>
<p class="verse">But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</p>
<p class="verse">Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</p>
<p class="verse">Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?</p>
<p class="verse">And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?</p>
<p class="verse">For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-james-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.</p>
<p class="verse">For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.</p>
<p class="verse">Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!</p>
<p class="verse">And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.</p>
<p class="verse">For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:</p>
<p class="verse">But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.</p>
<p class="verse">Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</p>
<p class="verse">Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?</p>
<p class="verse">Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.</p>
<p class="verse">Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse">But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.</p>
<p class="verse">This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.</p>
<p class="verse">For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.</p>
<p class="verse">But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.</p>
<p class="verse">And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-james-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?</p>
<p class="verse">Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?</p>
<p class="verse">But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.</p>
<p class="verse">Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</p>
<p class="verse">Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.</p>
<p class="verse">Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.</p>
<p class="verse">Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.</p>
<p class="verse">Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.</p>
<p class="verse">There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?</p>
<p class="verse">Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:</p>
<p class="verse">Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.</p>
<p class="verse">For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.</p>
<p class="verse">But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.</p>
<p class="verse">Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-james-5">
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you.</p>
<p class="verse">Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.</p>
<p class="verse">Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.</p>
<p class="verse">Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.</p>
<p class="verse">Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.</p>
<p class="verse">Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.</p>
<p class="verse">Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.</p>
<p class="verse">Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.</p>
<p class="verse">But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.</p>
<p class="verse">Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.</p>
<p class="verse">Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:</p>
<p class="verse">And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.</p>
<p class="verse">Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</p>
<p class="verse">Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.</p>
<p class="verse">And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.</p>
<p class="verse">Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;</p>
<p class="verse">Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,</p>
<p class="verse">Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.</p>
<p class="verse">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</p>
<p class="verse">To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,</p>
<p class="verse">Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:</p>
<p class="verse">That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse">Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:</p>
<p class="verse">Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.</p>
<p class="verse">Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:</p>
<p class="verse">Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.</p>
<p class="verse">Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;</p>
<p class="verse">As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:</p>
<p class="verse">But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;</p>
<p class="verse">Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.</p>
<p class="verse">And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man’s work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:</p>
<p class="verse">Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;</p>
<p class="verse">But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:</p>
<p class="verse">Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,</p>
<p class="verse">Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.</p>
<p class="verse">Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently:</p>
<p class="verse">Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:</p>
<p class="verse">But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 peter-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,</p>
<p class="verse">As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:</p>
<p class="verse">If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.</p>
<p class="verse">To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,</p>
<p class="verse">Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.</p>
<p class="verse">Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,</p>
<p class="verse">And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.</p>
<p class="verse">But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:</p>
<p class="verse">Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</p>
<p class="verse">Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;</p>
<p class="verse">Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.</p>
<p class="verse">Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;</p>
<p class="verse">Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.</p>
<p class="verse">For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:</p>
<p class="verse">As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.</p>
<p class="verse">Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.</p>
<p class="verse">Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.</p>
<p class="verse">For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.</p>
<p class="verse">For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.</p>
<p class="verse">For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:</p>
<p class="verse">Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:</p>
<p class="verse">Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:</p>
<p class="verse">Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.</p>
<p class="verse">For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 peter-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;</p>
<p class="verse">While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.</p>
<p class="verse">Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;</p>
<p class="verse">But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.</p>
<p class="verse">For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:</p>
<p class="verse">Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.</p>
<p class="verse">Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:</p>
<p class="verse">Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.</p>
<p class="verse">For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:</p>
<p class="verse">Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.</p>
<p class="verse">For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.</p>
<p class="verse">And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?</p>
<p class="verse">But and if ye suffer for righteousness’ sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;</p>
<p class="verse">But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:</p>
<p class="verse">Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.</p>
<p class="verse">For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:</p>
<p class="verse">By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;</p>
<p class="verse">Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.</p>
<p class="verse">The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse">Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 peter-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse">Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;</p>
<p class="verse">That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.</p>
<p class="verse">For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:</p>
<p class="verse">Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:</p>
<p class="verse">Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.</p>
<p class="verse">For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.</p>
<p class="verse">But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.</p>
<p class="verse">And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.</p>
<p class="verse">Use hospitality one to another without grudging.</p>
<p class="verse">As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</p>
<p class="verse">If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:</p>
<p class="verse">But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.</p>
<p class="verse">If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.</p>
<p class="verse">But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men’s matters.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.</p>
<p class="verse">For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?</p>
<p class="verse">And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 peter-5">
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse">The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:</p>
<p class="verse">Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;</p>
<p class="verse">Neither as being lords over God’s heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.</p>
<p class="verse">And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</p>
<p class="verse">Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:</p>
<p class="verse">Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.</p>
<p class="verse">Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:</p>
<p class="verse">Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.</p>
<p class="verse">But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.</p>
<p class="verse">To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse">By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.</p>
<p class="verse">The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son.</p>
<p class="verse">Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>

<p class="verse">For the truth’s sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.</p>

<p class="verse">Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</p>
<p class="verse">For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called:</p>
<p class="verse">Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.</p>
<p class="verse">Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.</p>
<p class="verse">For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.</p>
<p class="verse">And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.</p>
<p class="verse">Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.</p>
<p class="verse">Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.</p>
<p class="verse">But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.</p>
<p class="verse">Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.</p>
<p class="verse">These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;</p>
<p class="verse">Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.</p>
<p class="verse">And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,</p>
<p class="verse">To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.</p>
<p class="verse">These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men’s persons in admiration because of advantage.</p>
<p class="verse">But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;</p>
<p class="verse">How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.</p>
<p class="verse">These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse">But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,</p>
<p class="verse">Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse">And of some have compassion, making a difference:</p>
<p class="verse">And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.</p>
<p class="verse">Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,</p>
<p class="verse">To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class="verse">Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,</p>
<p class="verse">And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</p>
<p class="verse">Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</p>
<p class="verse">Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</p>
<p class="verse">That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse">For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</p>
<p class="verse">Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</p>
<p class="verse">Yet for love’s sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse">I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</p>
<p class="verse">Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</p>
<p class="verse">Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</p>
<p class="verse">Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</p>
<p class="verse">But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</p>
<p class="verse">For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</p>
<p class="verse">Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</p>
<p class="verse">If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</p>
<p class="verse">If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;</p>
<p class="verse">I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</p>
<p class="verse">Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse">Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</p>
<p class="verse">But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</p>
<p class="verse">There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse">The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.</p>
<p class="verse">God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.</p>
<p class="verse">He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languisheth.</p>
<p class="verse">The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.</p>
<p class="verse">Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.</p>
<p class="verse">The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him.</p>
<p class="verse">But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.</p>
<p class="verse">What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.</p>
<p class="verse">For while they be folden together as thorns, and while they are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry.</p>
<p class="verse">There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the LORD, a wicked counsellor.</p>
<p class="verse">Thus saith the LORD; Though they be quiet, and likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.</p>
<p class="verse">For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.</p>
<p class="verse">And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse">He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily.</p>
<p class="verse">For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches.</p>
<p class="verse">The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.</p>
<p class="verse">The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings.</p>
<p class="verse">He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared.</p>
<p class="verse">The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved.</p>
<p class="verse">And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts.</p>
<p class="verse">But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand, shall they cry; but none shall look back.</p>
<p class="verse">Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for there is none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant furniture.</p>
<p class="verse">She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and much pain is in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness.</p>
<p class="verse">Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of the young lions, where the lion, even the old lion, walked, and the lion’s whelp, and none made them afraid?</p>
<p class="verse">The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse">Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and robbery; the prey departeth not;</p>
<p class="verse">The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping chariots.</p>
<p class="verse">The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear: and there is a multitude of slain, and a great number of carcases; and there is none end of their corpses; they stumble upon their corpses:</p>
<p class="verse">Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts; and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.</p>
<p class="verse">And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock.</p>
<p class="verse">And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?</p>
<p class="verse">Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the rivers, that had the waters round about it, whose rampart was the sea, and her wall was from the sea?</p>
<p class="verse">Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers.</p>
<p class="verse">Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy.</p>
<p class="verse">All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater.</p>
<p class="verse">Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women: the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire shall devour thy bars.</p>
<p class="verse">Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go into clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln.</p>
<p class="verse">There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.</p>
<p class="verse">Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and fleeth away.</p>
<p class="verse">Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy captains as the great grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they are.</p>
<p class="verse">Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell in the dust: thy people is scattered upon the mountains, and no man gathereth them.</p>
<p class="verse">There is no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee: for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?</p>
