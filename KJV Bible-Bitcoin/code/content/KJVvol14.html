<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men’s persons in admiration because of advantage.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And of some have compassion, making a difference:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare him after Absalom.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah the king’s servants:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king’s sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47:</span>And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48:</span>And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49:</span>And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50:</span>And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51:</span>And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52:</span>And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53:</span>So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1 kings-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother’s: for it was his from the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the LORD God before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>So Solomon built the house, and finished it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits high.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were all molten.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of bright brass.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47:</span>And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48:</span>And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread was,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49:</span>And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50:</span>And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51:</span>So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name’s sake;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>(For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house;</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I have built for thy name:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48:</span>And so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49:</span>Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50:</span>And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51:</span>For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52:</span>That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53:</span>For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O LORD God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54:</span>And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55:</span>And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56:</span>Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57:</span>The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">58:</span>That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">59:</span>And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">60:</span>That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">61:</span>Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">62:</span>And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">63:</span>And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">64:</span>The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brasen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">65:</span>And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">66:</span>On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king’s house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s household among the sons of Pharaoh.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon’s servant, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant’s sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which stood before him:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father’s loins.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men’s counsel that they gave him;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him.

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again.

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which the Lord did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake unto him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the carcase, nor torn the ass.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel’s table.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal’s prophets are four hundred and fifty men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man’s hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Benhadad,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Benhadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not unto him, nor consent.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array against the city.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Even by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, Thou.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD is God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left. And Benhadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Benhadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy brother Benhadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten hither Micaiah the son of Imlah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the king’s hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto me, that will I speak.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the LORD which he spake.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47:</span>There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48:</span>Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49:</span>Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50:</span>And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51:</span>Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52:</span>And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53:</span>For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>

<h3>Chapter 27</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by thy estimation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy estimation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest’s.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD’s firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the LORD’s.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD’s: it is holy unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Yet for love’s sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</p>

Revelations Chapter 20: 1-3 "And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season".
