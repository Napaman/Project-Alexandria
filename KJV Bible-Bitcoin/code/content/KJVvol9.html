<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Not of works, lest any man should boast.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>One Lord, one faith, one baptism,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>But ye have not so learned Christ;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Neither give place to the devil.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven you.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Be not ye therefore partakers with them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin’s captivity,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>For they are impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear your lies?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt to make them fly.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of Canaan; thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live; yea, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent ornaments: thy breasts are fashioned, and thine hair is grown, whereas thou wast naked and bare.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers’ skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didst give unto them;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>Thou art thy mother’s daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an Amorite.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47:</span>Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing, thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48:</span>As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49:</span>Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">50:</span>And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">51:</span>Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">52:</span>Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">53:</span>When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">54:</span>That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">55:</span>When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">56:</span>For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">57:</span>Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of thy reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise thee round about.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">58:</span>Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">59:</span>For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">60:</span>Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">61:</span>Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">62:</span>And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">63:</span>That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings, longwinged, full of feathers, which had divers colours, came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, and set it as a willow tree.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to enquire of the LORD, and sat before me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Then came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I am the LORD your God;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>In the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers’ idols.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they should not live;</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that ye say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will not hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>

<h3>Chapter 23</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idols.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32:</span>Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister’s cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33:</span>Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34:</span>Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35:</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">36:</span>The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">37:</span>That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">38:</span>Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">39:</span>For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she with them?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">45:</span>And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">46:</span>For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">47:</span>And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">48:</span>Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">49:</span>And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.</p>

<h3>Chapter 24</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Son of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour water into it:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, and make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew them unto thee art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man’s hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">40:</span>And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">41:</span>Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew their sacrifices.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">42:</span>And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">43:</span>And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">44:</span>And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the oil, every morning for a continual burnt offering.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Thus saith the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons’; it shall be their possession by inheritance.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Moreover the prince shall not take of the people’s inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; but he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the two sides westward.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear them not out into the utter court, to sanctify the people.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of one measure.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>And there was a row of building round about in them, round about them four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Then said he unto me, These are the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And profited in the Jews’ religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called me by his grace,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And they glorified God in me.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-galatians-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man’s person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man’s covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31:</span>So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Do all things without murmurings and disputings:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27:</span>For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28:</span>I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29:</span>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30:</span>Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-philippians-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar’s household.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 timothy-2">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, and prepared unto every good work.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23:</span>But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24:</span>And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25:</span>In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26:</span>And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 timothy-3">
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-2 timothy-4">
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1:</span>I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2:</span>Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3:</span>For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4:</span>And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5:</span>But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6:</span>For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7:</span>I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8:</span>Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9:</span>Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10:</span>For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11:</span>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12:</span>And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13:</span>The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14:</span>Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15:</span>Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16:</span>At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17:</span>Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18:</span>And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19:</span>Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20:</span>Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21:</span>Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</p>
<p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22:</span>The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</p>

<p class="private-message">Στην οικογένειά μου και τον Θεό που μας καθοδηγεί. Inspired by a conversation on Degen Saturdays between @AdrianDittmann and @T_Bilderberg. Revelations Chapter 20: 1-3 "And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season".
